        Network packet headers contain a great deal of information, but the
kernel often only needs a subset of that information to be able to perform
filtering or associate any given packet with a flow. The piece of code that
follows the different layers of packet encapsulation to find the important
data is called a flow dissector. In current Linux kernels, the <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.18.6/source/net/core/flow_dissector.c">flow
dissector</a>
is written in C. A <a href="/Articles/763938/">patch set</a> has been
proposed recently to implement it in BPF with the clear goal of improving
security, flexibility, and maybe even performance.

Security and convenience rarely go hand-in-hand, but if your job (or life)
requires extraordinary care against potentially targeted attacks, the
security side of that tradeoff may win out.  If so, running a system like
<a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes&nbsp;OS</a> on your desktop or <a
href="https://copperhead.co/">CopperheadOS</a> on your phone might make sense,
which is just what Konstantin Ryabitsev, Linux Foundation (LF) director of IT
security, has done.  He reported on the experience in a <a

        The Spectre variant 2 vulnerability allows the speculative execution of
incorrect (in an attacker-controllable way) indirect branch predictions,
resulting in 
the ability to exfiltrate information via side channels.  The kernel has
been reasonably well protected against this variant since shortly after its
disclosure in January.  It is, however, possible for user-space processes
to use Spectre v2 to attack each other; thus far, the mainline kernel has
offered relatively little protection against such attacks.  A recent <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/nycvar.YFH.7.76.1809041619510.15880@cbobk.fhfr.pm/">proposal</a>
from Jiri Kosina may change that situation, but there are still some
disagreements around the details.

        Mozilla has released Firefox 62.0, with several new features. The Firefox
Home (default New Tab) allows users to display up to 4 rows of top sites,
Pocket stories, and highlights; for those using containers there is menu
option to reopen a tab in a different container; Firefox 63 will remove all
trust for Symantec-issued certificates, and it is optional in Firefox
62; FreeBSD support for WebAuthn was added; and more. See the <a

        It is common for kernel code to generate unique integers for identifiers.
When one plugs in a flash drive, it will show up as
<tt>/dev/sdN</tt>; that <tt>N</tt> (a letter derived from a
number) must be generated in the
kernel, and it should not already be in use for another drive or unpleasant
things will happen.  One might think that generating such numbers would not
be a difficult task, but that turns out not to be the case, especially in
situations where many numbers must be tracked.  The IDA (for "ID
allocator", perhaps) API exists to handle this specialized task.  In past
kernels, it has managed to make the process of getting an unused number
surprisingly 
complex; the 4.19 kernel has a new IDA API that simplifies things
considerably.

        The developers of the Android system have, among their many goals, the wish
to better protect Android devices against persistent compromise.  It is bad
if a device is taken over by an attacker; it's worse if it remains
compromised even after a reboot.  Numerous mechanisms for ensuring the
integrity of  installed system files have been proposed and implemented
over the years.  But it seems there is always room for one more; to fill
that space, the <a

mechanism is being proposed as a way to protect individual files from

        Many services, from web hosting and video streaming to cloud storage,
need to move data to and from storage.  They also often require that each per-client
I/O flow be guaranteed a non-zero amount of bandwidth and a bounded latency. An
expensive way to provide these guarantees is to over-provision
storage resources, keeping each resource underutilized, and thus
have plenty of bandwidth available for the few I/O flows dispatched to
each medium. Alternatively one can use an I/O controller.  Linux provides
two mechanisms designed to throttle some I/O streams to allow others to
meet their bandwidth and latency requirements.  These mechanisms work, but
they come at a cost: a loss of as much as 80% of total available I/O
bandwidth.  I have run some tests to demonstrate this problem; some
upcoming improvements to the <a href="/Articles/601799/">bfq I/O
scheduler</a> promise to improve the situation considerably.

        The <a href="/Articles/763988/">4.19-rc2</a> kernel prepatch is out for
testing.
"<span>As usual, the rc2 release is pretty small. People are taking a
breather after the merge window, and it takes a bit of time for bug
reports to start coming in and get identified.</span>"
