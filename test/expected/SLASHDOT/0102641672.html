		Hikers, park rangers, and summer residents of Iceland&#x27;s northernmost peninsula are seeking to keep the area free from internet service, worrying that all that comes with it &quot;will destroy a way of life that depends on the absence of [email, news, and social media],&quot; reports the Associated Press. &quot;The area has long resisted cell towers, but commercial initiatives could take the decision out of Icelanders&#x27; hands and push Hornstrandir across the digital divide.&quot; From the report: Despite or because of its remoteness, Iceland ranks first on a U.N. index comparing nations by information technology use, with roughly 98 percent of the population using the internet. Among adults, 93 percent report having Facebook accounts and two-thirds are Snapchat users, according to pollster MMR. Many people who live in northwestern Iceland or visit as outdoor enthusiasts want Hornstrandir&#x27;s 570 square kilometers (220 square miles), which accounts for 0.6 percent of Iceland&#x27;s land mass, to be declared a &quot;digital-free zone.&quot; The idea hasn&#x27;t coalesced into a petition or formal campaign, so what it would require or prohibit hasn&#x27;t been fleshed out. The last full-time resident of the rugged area moved away in 1952 -- it never was an easy place to farm -- but many descendants have turned family farmsteads into summer getaways. Northwest Iceland&#x27;s representative, Halla Signy Kristjansdottir, is in favor of adding cell towers for the safety of sailors and travelers in the area. &quot;I don&#x27;t see anything romantic about lying on the ground with a broken thigh bone and no cellphone signal,&quot; Kristjansdottir said in an interview.

Sometimes it's easier to buy a vacation that makes the choice for you, than having to, repeatedly, make the same choice throughout the entire vacation. Picking a destination that has no access means you can re-focus on other forms of entertainment. Its easy to fall back into habits. By picking a spot with no access, you are not fighting temptation, and i dare say withdrawal, the entire time. The price of vacati</p></div>

Here's the joke everyone over the age of 8 here knows:</p><p>Q: What do you do if you get lost in an Icelandic forest?</p><p>A: Stand up.</p><p>I've actually not been to Hornstrandir; it's been on my TODO list for a long, long time, but I've lacked one of the obligatory "round tuits". So it's actually surprising to hear that there's not internet access (via cell towers) there, because in general even the most remote places here have cell access. When Bárðarbunga erupted, deep in the highlands, the eruption was livestreamed. And there's a lot more people in Vestfirðir then in the highlands!</p><p>This would of course be more about visitors than residents, given that there's no permanent residents in Hornstrandir. And in some ways I can sympathize. For example, there's always a lot of opposition to improving the highland roads because we don't want to have more cars driving through and tons of people flooding in, and driving really fast on some paved road would totally change the experience of going into the highlands... it would just turn into a set of "sites to see" rather than a journey. The effect of the isolation on you can really be profound. You feel like a person exploring Mars - so tiny in an endless empty expanse, completely devoid of any signs of human civilization except the half-bulldozed-out "road" you take, the endless travel punctured by rushes of adrenaline as you try to ford a river or trying to avoid ruining your car crossing a lava field. And people who know that experience generally don't want to see it altered. So I imagine it's the same thing for Hornstrandir. The difference being, as previously mentioned, in much of the highlands there's cell coverage. At least as far as I know, when I go out I'm not checking Facebook all the time.  ;) But I don't recall any meaningful loss of coverage events.</p><p>ED: Just checked [1]a map [wp.com] from my cell provider. Looks like most of Hornstrandir is indeed marked in white (no coverage), while most of the highlands is light blue (2G) or in some places blue (3G) - even a good chunk of Vatnajökull (largest glacier in Europe).</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>[1] https://i2.wp.com/www.icelandnorthernlightshq.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-27-at-09.57.16.png?ssl=1</p></div>

      <div class='comment_content'><p></p><p>Actually this intrigues me. I go on cruises for the same getaway. Sure one can declare a weekend of no devices or technology, but theres always something that comes up that eventually screws that up. I go on cruises with the family and we do not buy the internet package. The fact that its ridiculously expensive helps 'cut the cord' when on vacation. The most online time the kids ever experience is when we pull into a port and visit a place that has 'free wifi'; giving them 30-60 min of checking their email</p></div>

I'm not the best a geography, and I had thought Iceland was a bit further south. I didn't realize it was north of the southern tip of Greenland. That could well be outside the range of satellite Internet, depending on the orbits involved. I have no idea what the plans are.</p></div>

The real problem was the astronomical cost of those links, short of a stationary polar orbit satellite there is no real way to keep it cheap. So they've been building fiber as a replacement since 2012ish for the far north remote communities at least here in Canada. I think Resolute was finished in 2016ish or so.</p></div>
