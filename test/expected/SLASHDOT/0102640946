    An   anonymous   reader   quotes  a  report  from  Motherboard:
    Wednesday,  Valve,  the  company  that operates the huge online
    video  game store Steam, shared more details about how it plans
    to  control  and  moderate  the ever-increasing number of games
    published  on  its  platform.  In the post published Wednesday,
    Valve  shared  more  details  about  how  it determines what it
    considers  "outright trolling." "It is vague and we'll tell you
    why,"  Valve  wrote.  "You're  a denizen of the internet so you
    know  that  trolls come in all forms. On Steam, some are simply
    trying  to rile people up with something we call 'a game shaped
    object'  (ie: a crudely made piece of software that technically
    and  just barely passes our bar as a functioning video game but
    isn't  what  99.9% of folks would say is "good.") Valve goes on
    to  explain  that  some  trolls are trying to scam folks out of
    their  Steam  inventory items (digital items that can be traded
    for  real  money),  while others are trying to generate a small
    amount  of  money  through a variety of schemes that have to do
    with  how  developers  use  keys  to  unlock Steam games, while
    others  are  trying  to  "incite  and sow discord." "Trolls are
    figuring  out new ways to be loathsome as we write this," Valve
    said.  "But  the  thing these folks have in common is that they
    aren't  actually  interested  in good faith efforts to make and
    sell  games to you or anyone. When a developer's motives aren't
    that,  they're  probably  a troll." One interesting observation
    Valve   shares  in  the  blog  post  is  that  it  rarely  bans
    individual  games  from  Steam,  and more often bans developers
    and/or  publishers  entirely.  [...] Valve said that its review
    process  for  determining  that something may be a "troll game"
    is  a  "deep  assessment"  that  involves investigating who the
    developer  is, what they've done in the past, their behavior on
    Steam   as   a   developer,   as   a  customer,  their  banking
    information, developers they associate with, and more.

     98% of the total garbage disappears (as well as a few percent of
     the good). Of course "not terribly good games" will still
     appear, but it gets rid of the absolute garbage.
     Or if people are appalled at paying to appear on Steam, allow
     spending $10K for a Steam "check-mark of marketing", and allow
     users to filter to show only check-marked games.

        because there's no accounting for taste, and if you took away

        man's trash is another's treasure.
        
        Plus, a lot of good devs get their start making trash.

           I'm sorry, but anyone with a functioning brain would see
           that infinitely more effort and polish has been put in to
           games like Goat Simulator than any of those garbage "asset
           flips" that litter the Steam store.
           Yes the difference between a good and bad game is
           subjective, but broken zero effort trash is much easier to
           agree on...

        Will never happen. There are way too many games like PUBG
        that would've never become Steam hits if they had such a
        policy. It only needs to be enough to make the trolls miss
        it/lose out with their scams; $100 would likely be enough.

        Either would shut a lot of starting indie games developers
        out of the system, thus preventing said developers and the
        gaming industry in general from making future hits.
        Basically, all new games are either essentially
        reskins/clones of existing games, or trying new mechanics
        and/or interactions, and sometimes (rarely) stories and
        characters. Given the typical indie level production values
        are garbage, in general, only the ones that try to innovate
        actually do have some value for the industry. However, first

     Imagine how much easier browsing Netflix would be if you could
     filter out whole franchises and showrunners. Of course, that

           Sounds like Amazon, and the Kindle Library. No matter what
           you search, every 7th listing is a 'Sponsored' listing,
           and even if you specify a particular author or absolute
           title, you always get 10 or 12 additional 'bonus' items

     How about if a developer starts a EA Project and walks away

        Furthermore, unlike console and mobile platforms, Steam has
        very little switching cost. An end user can always just up
        and switch to Itch or Origin or GOG or Humble or wherever

     So Steam started as "shove it down their throats" Counter Strike
     1.6 launcher. Evolved into highly curated game store over about
     a decade.
     Then decided to suddenly drop all curation and allow anything
     and everything on the platform. Got flooded with garbage. Added
     weird "meta gaming" shit like trading cards. Got games that
     literally existed just to allow people to get cards. Allowed
     some trading and other meta gaming of the system. Even got
     pressured by some SJW types to drop politically controversial
     games like Hatred and even had their recent porn games brouhaha.
     And now, they're doing this. I guess there's just too much
     pressure from all directions, and they really just decided that
     no, we're not bending to various pressure groups, and instead
     just making sure that asset flips and such are not on the store.
     If true, good on them.
