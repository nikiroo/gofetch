    The  National  Academies  Press has released a 156-page report,
    called  "Securing  the  Vote:  Protecting  American Democracy,"
    concluding  that blockchains are not safe for the U.S. election
    system.   "While  the  notion  of  using  a  blockchain  as  an
    immutable  ballot box may seem promising, blockchain technology
    does  little  to  solve  the  fundamental  security  issues  of
    elections,   and   indeed,   blockchains  introduce  additional
    security  vulnerabilities,"  the report states. "In particular,
    if  malware  on  a  voter's device alters a vote before it ever
    reaches  a blockchain, the immutability of the blockchain fails
    to  provide the desired integrity, and the voter may never know
    of   the   alteration."   The   report  goes  on  to  say  that
    "Blockchains  do  not  provide  the anonymity often ascribed to
    them."  It  continues: "In the particular context of elections,
    voters  need  to  be  authorized as eligible to vote and as not
    having  cast  more  than one ballot in the particular election.
    Blockchains  do  not  offer  means  for providing the necessary
    authorization.  [...]  If  a  blockchain  is  used,  then  cast
    ballots  must  be  encrypted or otherwise anonymized to prevent
    coercion  and  vote-selling." The New York Times summarizes the
    findings:  The  cautiously  worded  report calls for conducting
    all  federal,  state  and  local  elections on paper ballots by
    2020.  Its  other  top  recommendation would require nationwide
    use  of a specific form of routine postelection audit to ensure
    votes  have  been accurately counted. The panel did not offer a
    price  tag  for its recommended overhaul. New York University's
    Brennan  Center  has  estimated  that  replacing  aging  voting
    machines  over  the  next  few  years  could  cost well over $1
    billion.  The  156-page  report  [...] bemoans a rickety system
    compromised  by  insecure  voting  equipment and software whose
    vulnerabilities  were  exposed more than a decade ago and which
    are  too  often  managed  by  officials with little training in
    cybersecurity.   Among   its  specific  recommendations  was  a
    mainstay  of  election  reformers:  All  elections  should  use
    human-readable   paper   ballots  by  2020.  Such  systems  are
    intended   to  assure  voters  that  their  vote  was  recorded
    accurately.  They  also  create  a  lasting  record  of  "voter
    intent"  that  can be used for reliable recounts, which may not
    be  possible in systems that record votes electronically. [...]
    The  panel  also  calls  for  all  states  to  adopt  a type of
    post-election   audit  that  employs  statistical  analysis  of
    ballots  prior  to  results certification. Such "risk-limiting"
    audits  are  designed  to uncover miscounts and vote tampering.
    Currently only three states mandate them.

        Oh, you are so close to a breakthrough.
        When it comes to voting, blockchain, like software, IS
        inherently unsafe. If the main goal for voting security is
        maintaining the people's confidence in an election, the only
        system that will meet that standard is a system where people
        are actually keeping an eye on one another. And I mean
        physically watching one another. And that's the system we had
        in place before the advent of voting machines and election
        software. You had a room full of election judges from both
        sides, and they sat side-by-side checking in voters as they
        approached the voting booth and physically watched them put
        the ballot in the box. When the votes were counted, there was
        a whole bunch of people from both parties standing around
        keeping a close eye. When the ballots were sent for storage,
        one person from each party rode in the truck to drop them off
        after sealing the container - together - and signing off.
        It was trust, but verify. Was it possible to jigger with an
        election like that? Of course. But you had a list of names of
        people you could hold accountable at every step in the
        process. Electronic voting will never, ever be trusted. That
        is the effect of transparency.

        Blockchains are obviously a terrible solution to election
        fraud. The only thing that prevents blockchain tampering is a
        ton of neutral third party machines checking the transactions
        (typically miners). We've already seen that this is a
        non-trivial problem when there is plenty of incentive for
        random people to fulfill that role (mining of crypto
