    >> EVE Online
    
    >  developer  CCP  Games  [2]has been acquired by Pearl Abyss ,
    the  South  Korean  studio  behind  the  action-oriented MMORPG
    Black  Desert  Online.  According  to [3]VentureBeat , the deal
    was  worth $425 million and will close in early October. It's a
    surprise  announcement  for  CCP, which has long operated as an
    independent  developer.  Eve Online isn't the biggest MMORPG on
    the  market,  but it has maintained a steady and loyal userbase
    through  continuous updates and a well-timed switch to a hybrid
    premium   and  free-to-play  model.  The  15-year-old  game  is
    unique,  too,  with  its  large-scale  battles  and notoriously
    complex economic and political systems.

        If someone could make EVE more grindy, it would be a Korean
        MMO maker. I don't see them misunderstanding that aspect, as
        they invented Korean Grinder.

           Son, if Koreans will do anything it's inject sexy alien
           women and bikini-space-armor into it.
           East Asia never suffered the retardation of puritanism,
           which is unique to the Western world owing to Abrahamic
           doctrine, to develop Gymnophobia and Genophobia, so they
           don't care about the Church-Feminist anti-sexualization
           offense alliance. The only exception are the "Communist"
           governments there.

           It was bad in the beta and never actually recovered from
           some pretty bad development choices. Have they discovered
           parallel processing yet? And version management? Okay, I
           guess the last one was a bit mean. They must have
           discovered Git by now.
           But seriously, the game is an unstructured mess. Played it
           for a while, flew a Machariel and did incursions, level 4
           missions etc. but after a while it got boring. May pick it
           up again though.

        Sometimes, I thought Stallman was being a pendant for gripes
        about terminology like "intellectual property".
        Now I realize he was exactly right.
        This guy uses the words "virtual goods", like it's something
        he'll actually own. Dollars to donuts, the EULA and TOS says
        these 'virtual goods' are nothing more than bits on their
        server, you don't own a single bit of it, and they do
        whatever they like, and fuck you we're keeping your money if
        you don't like it.

              The current beta is 3 moons, 2 stations, and a shitty
              framework of a "game" that runs at 10fps on a GTX1060

                 They're not even in Alpha. They call it that, but
                 what it actually is, is "perpetual development
                 hell". It doesn't have a version number but if it

        Makes me wonder too. I wonder if White Wolf would be sold off
        (likely) or spun off (unlikely, but would be nicer). My fear
        is that it gets tossed to some big company, and the IP
        completely shelved, never to see the light of day again,
        similar to how EA has done with a lot of Origin IP.

     As it is, it's already a griefing sandbox with little wiggle

     industry or fleet ops. When it could be far more balanced and
     appeal to a larger player base.
     Pushing it further into "gang warfare" style griefing will
     eventually make the player base smaller.

        Your description of events is the exact opposite of your

        greatness, because the process you describe functions exactly
        like real world functions on macro level.
        The fact that they apparently managed to recreated the world
        on macro level in a game through long standing player
        interactions in less than two decades is mind blowingly
        amazing.
