    Open  .git  directories are a bigger cybersecurity problem than
    many  might  imagine,  at  least  according to a Czech security
    researcher  who  [1]discovered almost 400,000 web pages with an
    open  .git  directory possibly exposing a wide variety of data.
    From a report:
    
    >  Vladimir  Smitka  began  his  .git directory odyssey in July
    when  he  began looking at Czech websites to find how many were
    improperly  configured  and  allow access to their .git folders
    within  the file versions repository. Open .git directories are
    a  particularly  dangerous  issue,  he  said,  because they can
    contain  a  great  deal  of sensitive information. "Information
    about  the  website's structure, and sometimes you can get very
    sensitive   data   such   as   database  passwords,  API  keys,
    development  IDE  settings,  and  so  on.  However,  this  data
    shouldn't  be  stored  in the repository, but in previous scans
    of  various  security issues, I have found many developers that
    do  not  follow  these  best  practices,"  Smitka wrote. Smitka
    queried  230  million websites to discover the 390,000 allowing
    access  to  their  .git  directories.  The vast majority of the
    websites  with  open directories had a .com TLD with .net, .de,
    .org and uk comprising most of the others.

        And it probably is. The thing is, the website owners are
        using git to version control and deploy their website (not a
        bad idea). So they develop their web site, push it to the
        central git repo, and whenever they need to go live, they
        just do a "git pull" on the webserver and it'll pull down the
        latest version of the website.
        Problem is, they forget about the hidden  .git directory git
        makes that stores all sorts of useful information and with a
        little persistence, allow you access to the raw source code
        since you can access the individual git objects. (Or maybe
        even clone it using git).

           I do this, it is very convenient for deploying updates to
           the site. But I always put the web interface into a
           subdirectory, and only configure the web server to see
           that so the  .git directory is not visible over HTTP. And
           dotfiles and directories are blocked in the webserver
           config for extra protection against accidental inclusion
           of invisible files.

     An open git directory will be everything you need to reconstruct
     the site, more often than not from the same server you're
     targeting. Scary. Database servers are rarely open. Short of
     some serious hacking, there isn't a lot you're going to be able
     to do with this stuff once you've obtained the information
     you're waving around here.
     Until such time as I see hackers actually logging in with this
     information and defacing github, I'm going to remain unconvinced
     of the severity of this one.

        My website's  .git directories are open intentionally. Makes
        for convenient mirroring and viewing of archives without
        having to hope and pray wayback machine picked up my obscure
        website.
        I'm not too worried. It's just data on the filesystem, it's
        not executing programs. And the data is not supposed to
        contain any secrets. If it ever does then I better rewrite my
        git history.

        The most likely actual security implication is hard coded
        keys to 3rd party APIs.
        Not that this is an inevitable threat, itâ(TM)s just
        something I could see being inadvertently exposed and useful
        without much additional effort.

        What about if that  .git folder (and the website's source
        code) included private keys for stuff. Or credentials/API
        keys for 3rd party services. Or credentials for database and
        other servers.
