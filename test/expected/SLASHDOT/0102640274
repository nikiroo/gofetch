    pgmrdlm  shares a report from The Verge: Best known for coining
    the  phrase  "net  neutrality"  and his book The Master Switch:
    The  Rise  and  Fall  of Information Empires, Wu has a new book
    coming  out  in November called The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust
    in  the  New  Gilded  Age.  In it, he argues compellingly for a
    return  to  aggressive  antitrust  enforcement  in the style of
    Teddy  Roosevelt,  saying  that  Google,  Facebook, Amazon, and
    other  huge  tech  companies  are a threat to democracy as they
    get  bigger and bigger. "We live in America, which has a strong
    and  proud  tradition of breaking up companies that are too big
    for  inefficient reasons," Wu told me on this week's Vergecast.
    "We  need  to  reverse  this  idea  that  it's  not an American
    tradition.  We've  broken  up dozens of companies." "I think if
    you  took  a  hard  look  at  the  acquisition  of WhatsApp and
    Instagram,  the argument that the effects of those acquisitions
    have  been  anticompetitive would be easy to prove for a number
    of  reasons,"  says Wu. And breaking up the company wouldn't be
    hard,  he  says.  "What  would  be  the harm? You'll have three
    competitors.  It's  not  'Oh my god, if you get rid of WhatsApp
    and  Instagram,  well  then  the  whole  world's  going to fall
    apart.'  It  would  be  like 'Okay, now you have some companies
    actually  trying  to  offer  you  an alternative to Facebook.'"
    Breaking  up  Facebook  (and  other  huge  tech  companies like
    Google  and  Amazon)  could  be  simple  under the current law,
    suggests  Wu.  But  it could also lead to a major rethinking of
    how  antitrust  law  should  work  in  a  world where the giant
    platform  companies  give their products away for free, and the
    ability  for  the  government to restrict corporate power seems
    to  be diminishing by the day. And it demands that we all think
    seriously  about  the  conditions  that  create  innovation. "I
    think  everyone's  steering way away from the monopolies, and I
    think it's hurting innovation in the tech sector," says Wu.

        The solution is to reestablish 'common carrier' protections

        I didn't read the article, but the summary has nothing to do
        with what you're talking about. The issue at hand is
        monopolies and the consequent stifling of innovation and lack
        of competitive pressure, that being the only thing which
        makes our economy work for people instead of against them.

        It's correct that people want one point of access to a thing,
        but nobody really wants a monopoly.
        Assuming that one inevitably leads to the other is part of
        the problem.
        For example, with the video streaming sites, what we really
        need is for them to collaborate on the platform (how you
        login and watch shit) but compete on the content, meaning
        that if you watch American Gods on the shared platform,
        Amazon gets paid a share of your subscription, yet if you

     Facebook has grown because it offered the best social platform
     for users. The point of social platforms is to connect with
     everyone else. Fragmentation means people needing to belong to
     and check multiple platforms. Trying to force competition won't
     solve any user issues. However, once Facebook stops providing a
     compelling service, people will move on their own. The same as
     they gave up MySpace and the same as they rejected Google+. The
     market chose Facebook and will purge it when time comes.
     The same with Google. There were plenty of entrenched search
     services when Google came to be. Users chose it because it was
     better. The old search services died because they didn't evolve.
     If Google stops being the best fit option, people will go
     somewhere else. They already have choices like Bing and Duck
     Duck Go. As the service is free, people are choosing based on
     functionality, not on price. Those that don't like the privacy
     price of Google are opting for other services. You can't just
     declare another search service is required and then force the
     public to use it so that you can claim to have multiple services
     with comparable market share.
     If people were given a choice of all you can eat steak or beets
     at equal cost, odds are that the majority would choose steak.
     When you remove cost and scarcity, the premium option will
     dominate. Digital services don't have scarcity like physical
     products do. It's a different economy.

        As stated in the summary: Facebook has grown by purchasing
        their competitors. The summary mentions WhatsApp and
        Instagram specifically.
        
        Your comment about the problem with fragmentation is an
        example of why Facebook needs to be broken up by an outside
        entity: they have a natural monopoly, since real competition
        from startups would lead to fragmentation.
        
        I've said this before, but if the government came along and

           While this is true, so far they have not bought their
           competitors to shut them down, or to raise prices to the
           detriment of consumers. They are building a monopoly, but
           so far, it is not harmful from an economic perspective,
           and unfortunately I don't think anti-trust law is
           concerned with privacy, so the case for breaking up
           Facebook is not strong.
           Apple would be a much juicier target, especially as they
