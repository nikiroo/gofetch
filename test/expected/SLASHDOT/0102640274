    [1]pgmrdlm shares a report from The Verge:
    
    >  Best  known  for coining the phrase "net neutrality" and his
    book  The  Master  Switch:  The  Rise  and  Fall of Information
    Empires,  Wu  has  a  new  book  coming  out in November called
    [2]The  Curse  of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age . In
    it,   he   argues  compellingly  for  a  return  to  aggressive
    antitrust  enforcement  in the style of Teddy Roosevelt, saying
    that  Google,  Facebook,  Amazon, and other huge tech companies
    [3]are  a  threat  to democracy as they get bigger and bigger .
    "We  live in America, which has a strong and proud tradition of
    breaking   up  companies  that  are  too  big  for  inefficient
    reasons,"  Wu  told  me  on  this week's Vergecast. "We need to
    reverse  this  idea  that it's not an American tradition. We've
    broken up dozens of companies."
    
    >
    
    >  "I  think  if  you  took  a  hard look at the acquisition of
    WhatsApp  and Instagram, the argument that the effects of those
    acquisitions  have  been anticompetitive would be easy to prove
    for  a number of reasons," says Wu. And breaking up the company
    wouldn't  be  hard,  he  says.  "What would be the harm? You'll
    have  three competitors. It's not 'Oh my god, if you get rid of
    WhatsApp  and  Instagram,  well then the whole world's going to
    fall  apart.'  It  would  be  like  'Okay,  now  you  have some
    companies  actually  trying  to  offer  you  an  alternative to
    Facebook.'"   Breaking   up   Facebook  (and  other  huge  tech
    companies  like  Google  and  Amazon) could be simple under the
    current  law,  suggests  Wu.  But it could also lead to a major
    rethinking  of  how  antitrust law should work in a world where
    the  giant  platform  companies  give  their  products away for
    free,  and the ability for the government to restrict corporate
    power  seems  to be diminishing by the day. And it demands that
    we  all  think  seriously  about  the  conditions  that  create
    innovation.  "I  think  everyone's  steering  way away from the
    monopolies,  and  I  think  it's hurting innovation in the tech
    sector," says Wu.

        I didn't read the article, but the summary has nothing to do
        with what you're talking about. The issue at hand is
        monopolies and the consequent stifling of innovation and lack
        of competitive pressure, that being the only thing which
        makes our economy work for people instead of against them.

        It's correct that people want one point of access to a thing,

        Assuming that one inevitably leads to the other is part of
        the problem.
        For example, with the video streaming sites, what we really
        need is for them to collaborate on the platform (how you
        login and watch shit) but compete on the content, meaning

     Facebook has grown because it offered the best social platform
     for users. The point of social platforms is to connect with
     everyone else. Fragmentation means people needing to belong to
     and check multiple platforms. Trying to force competition won't
     solve any user issues. However, once Facebook stops providing a
     compelling service, people will move on their own. The same as
     they gave up MySpace and the same as they rejected Google+. The
     market chose Facebook and will purge it when time comes.
     The same with Google. There were plenty of entrenched search
     services when Google came to be. Users chose it because it was
     better. The old search services died because they didn't evolve.
     If Google stops being the best fit option, people will go
     somewhere else. They already have choices like Bing and Duck
     Duck Go. As the service is free, people are choosing based on
     functionality, not on price. Those that don't like the privacy
     price of Google are opting for other services. You can't just
     declare another search service is required and then force the
     public to use it so that you can claim to have multiple services
     with comparable market share.
     If people were given a choice of all you can eat steak or beets
     at equal cost, odds are that the majority would choose steak.
     When you remove cost and scarcity, the premium option will
     dominate. Digital services don't have scarcity like physical
     products do. It's a different economy.

        As stated in the summary: Facebook has grown by purchasing
        their competitors. The summary mentions WhatsApp and
        Instagram specifically.
        
        Your comment about the problem with fragmentation is an
        example of why Facebook needs to be broken up by an outside
        entity: they have a natural monopoly, since real competition
        from startups would lead to fragmentation.
        
        I've said this before, but if the government came along and

           While this is true, so far they have not bought their
           competitors to shut them down, or to raise prices to the
           detriment of consumers. They are building a monopoly, but
           so far, it is not harmful from an economic perspective,
           and unfortunately I don't think anti-trust law is
           concerned with privacy, so the case for breaking up
           Facebook is not strong.
           Apple would be a much juicier target, especially as they
