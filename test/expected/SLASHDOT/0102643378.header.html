We recommend that you contact your bank or credit card provider and follow their recommended advice. We take the protection of your personal information very seriously. Please accept our deepest apologies for the worry and inconvenience that this criminal activity has caused.&quot; The breach has been &quot;resolved&quot; and the website is &quot;working normally,&quot; it said. In a statement, the airline added: &quot;We have notified the police and relevant authorities... [and] will continue to keep our customers updated with the very latest information. We will be contacting customers and will manage any claims on an individual basis.&quot;<br/><br/><br/><br/>[1] https://news.sky.com/story/ba-calls-in-police-over-customer-data-theft-from-website-11491980
