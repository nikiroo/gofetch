i  from the how-about-that dept.

i    For  all  the wishful thinking about manufacturing more laptops
i    and  iPhones  in  the  U.S.,  there  is  [1]one  sector of tech
i    manufacturing  where America remains a leader: computer chips .
i    From a report:
i    
i    >  Some  $44  billion worth of semiconductors are exported from
i    the  U.S.  each  year,  making  them  America's  fourth leading
i    manufacturing  export  after  cars,  airplanes and refined oil.
i    There  are  roughly  80  wafer fabrication plants (aka fabs) in
i    the  U.S., spread across 19 states. [...] An even greater share
i    of  the  world's  computer  chips are designed domestically and
i    made  overseas by companies including Qualcomm, Apple, Broadcom
i    and  Nvidia.  A  bunch  of the high-tech gear needed to produce
i    chips is also designed and/or made in the U.S.
