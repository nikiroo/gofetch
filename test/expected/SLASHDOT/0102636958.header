i    For  all  the wishful thinking about manufacturing more laptops
i    and   iPhones  in  the  U.S.,  there  is  one  sector  of  tech
i    manufacturing  where  America remains a leader: computer chips.
i    From  a  report:  Some  $44 billion worth of semiconductors are
i    exported  from the U.S. each year, making them America's fourth
i    leading  manufacturing export after cars, airplanes and refined
i    oil.  There  are roughly 80 wafer fabrication plants (aka fabs)
i    in  the  U.S.,  spread  across 19 states. [...] An even greater
i    share  of  the world's computer chips are designed domestically
i    and  made  overseas  by  companies  including  Qualcomm, Apple,
i    Broadcom  and  Nvidia.  A bunch of the high-tech gear needed to
i    produce chips is also designed and/or made in the U.S.
