    For  all  the wishful thinking about manufacturing more laptops
    and   iPhones  in  the  U.S.,  there  is  one  sector  of  tech
    manufacturing  where  America remains a leader: computer chips.
    From  a  report:  Some  $44 billion worth of semiconductors are
    exported  from the U.S. each year, making them America's fourth
    leading  manufacturing export after cars, airplanes and refined
    oil.  There  are roughly 80 wafer fabrication plants (aka fabs)
    in  the  U.S.,  spread  across 19 states. [...] An even greater
    share  of  the world's computer chips are designed domestically
    and  made  overseas  by  companies  including  Qualcomm, Apple,
    Broadcom  and  Nvidia.  A bunch of the high-tech gear needed to
    produce chips is also designed and/or made in the U.S.

        The only reason is automation. Jobs were never going to come
        back from chip manufacturing.
        They have a factory crew for setting up the parts and feeding
        the machines. Pretty cheap, doesn't actually make much money
        for anyone but the corporation running it. It's all
        "unskilled" and low pay...setting up all those machines,
        getting material dimensions in spec and running the machine
        is just considered general labor.

        Because most of the CPU silicon used in the commonest devices
        - phones and laptops - is fabbed in Asia.
        
        Because most of the parts - like screens, RAM and flash
        storage - are also made in Asia, so it's cheaper to bolt it
        all together in a location closest to the source of the most
        parts.
        
        Because final assembly of something like an iPhone is a
        manual process that requires the dexterity of nimble fingers.
        It's not quite the same as bolting doors onto a Chevvy.

        Because it hardly has any of the pieces right now - it would
        be a massive effort to put all the supply chains in place for
        the various electronics components needed for a whole
        computer when the US currently makes little more than chips.
        Currently those supply chains are in Asia (which also has the
        advantages of cheap labor and lax environmental laws). I'd
        compare it to going from just making engine blocks to making
        a whole car, but that underplays the difficulty too much.

     . . . computer chips with state-of-the-art lithography soon all
     will be manufactured overseas. Specifically, they will be made
     by exactly two companies, [1]Samsung [samsungfoundry.com] and
     [2]TSMC [tsmc.com], with GlobalFoundries' recent announcement
     that it is [3]stopping development of its 7nm process
     [anandtech.com]. GF operated the old IBM facility in Fishkill,
     NY, and AFAIK was the last company offering state-of-the-art
     foundry services with a fab in the US.
     Intel is still in business, of course, and even has a [4]foundry
     business [intel.com], but it cannot seem to successfully operate
     it -- substantially all of its wafer starts are chips of its own
     design. With the capital cost of each new-generation fab
     reaching $20 billion, it's only a matter of time until Intel --
     which has only its internal product base of chip designs to fill
     its fabs, while Samsung and TSMC make chips for the entire
     industry -- can no longer afford the move to the next
     generation.
     If the rest of the semiconductor industry (or the US DoD) wants
     high-performance computer chips, there's now nowhere to go
     except Samsung and TSMC. It will be interesting to see what
     politicians do when they realize that the best digital chips can
     no longer be manufactured in the US. The choice seems to be
     either (1) have our economy -- everything from cell phones to
     missiles -- dependent on chips manufactured overseas, or (2)
     subsidize Intel's foundry business and the semiconductor
     equipment manufacturers to the tune of tens of $billions, just
     to keep a US source of high-performance semiconductors.

           They gave up on the Moore's Law race 10 years ago after
