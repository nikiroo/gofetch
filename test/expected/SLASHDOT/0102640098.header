i    An  anonymous  reader  quotes a report from CNBC: As our global
i    economy  increasingly  comes to run on technology-enabled rails
i    and   every   company   becomes  a  tech  company,  demand  for
i    high-quality  software  engineers  is  at  an  all-time high. A
i    recent  study from Stripe and Harris Poll found that 61 percent
i    of  C-suite  executives believe access to developer talent is a
i    threat   to   the  success  of  their  business.  Perhaps  more
i    surprisingly  -- as we mark a decade after the financial crisis
i    --  this  threat was even ranked above capital constraints. And
i    yet,  despite  being many corporations' most precious resource,
i    developer  talents  are all too often squandered. Collectively,
i    companies  today lose upward of $300 billion a year paying down
i    "technical  debt,"  as  developers  pour  time into maintaining
i    legacy  systems  or  dealing  with  the  ramifications  of  bad
i    software.  This  is  especially  worrisome,  given the outsized
i    impact  developers  have  on  companies'  chances  of  success.
i    Software  developers  don't  have a monopoly on good ideas, but
i    their   skill   set  makes  them  a  uniquely  deep  source  of
i    innovation,  productivity  and  new  economic connections. When
i    deployed  correctly,  developers can be economic multipliers --
i    coefficients  that  dramatically  ratchet  up the output of the
i    teams and companies of which they're a part.
