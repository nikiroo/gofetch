i    An anonymous reader quotes a report from CNBC:
i    
i    >   As   our  global  economy  increasingly  comes  to  run  on
i    technology-enabled  rails  and  every  company  becomes  a tech
i    company,  demand  for  high-quality software engineers is at an
i    all-time  high.  A  recent study from [1]Stripe and Harris Poll
i    found  that  61 percent of C-suite executives believe access to
i    developer  talent is a threat to the success of their business.
i    Perhaps  more  surprisingly  --  as  we mark a decade after the
i    financial  crisis  --  [2]this  threat  was  even  ranked above
i    capital   constraints   .   And   yet,   despite   being   many
i    corporations'  most  precious  resource,  developer talents are
i    all  too  often  squandered. Collectively, companies today lose
i    upward  of $300 billion a year paying down "technical debt," as
i    developers   pour  time  into  maintaining  legacy  systems  or
i    dealing  with  the  ramifications  of  bad  software.  This  is
i    especially  worrisome,  given  the  outsized  impact developers
i    have  on  companies'  chances  of  success. Software developers
i    don't  have a monopoly on good ideas, but their skill set makes
i    them  a  uniquely  deep  source of innovation, productivity and
i    new  economic  connections. When deployed correctly, developers
i    can  be  economic multipliers -- coefficients that dramatically
i    ratchet  up  the  output  of  the  teams and companies of which
i    they're a part.
