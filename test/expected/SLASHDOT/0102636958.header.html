		For all the wishful thinking about manufacturing more laptops and iPhones in the U.S., there is [1]one sector of tech manufacturing where America remains a leader: computer chips . From a report:<br/><br/>&gt; Some $44 billion worth of semiconductors are exported from the U.S. each year, making them America&#x27;s fourth leading manufacturing export after cars, airplanes and refined oil. There are roughly 80 wafer fabrication plants (aka fabs) in the U.S., spread across 19 states. [...] An even greater share of the world&#x27;s computer chips are designed domestically and made overseas by companies including Qualcomm, Apple, Broadcom and Nvidia. A bunch of the high-tech gear needed to produce chips is also designed and/or made in the U.S.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[1] https://www.axios.com/computer-chips-manufacturing-america--10dcfe13-64f3-4ea9-ad4a-cb189a00429a.html
