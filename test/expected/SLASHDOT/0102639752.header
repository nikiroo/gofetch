i    Open  .git  directories are a bigger cybersecurity problem than
i    many  might  imagine,  at  least  according to a Czech security
i    researcher  who  discovered  almost  400,000  web pages with an
i    open  .git  directory possibly exposing a wide variety of data.
i    From  a  report:  Vladimir  Smitka  began  his  .git  directory
i    odyssey  in  July  when  he  began looking at Czech websites to
i    find  how  many  were improperly configured and allow access to
i    their  .git  folders  within the file versions repository. Open
i    .git  directories  are a particularly dangerous issue, he said,
i    because   they   can   contain   a   great  deal  of  sensitive
i    information.  "Information  about  the website's structure, and
i    sometimes  you  can  get  very  sensitive data such as database
i    passwords,  API  keys,  development  IDE  settings,  and so on.
i    However,  this  data shouldn't be stored in the repository, but
i    in  previous  scans  of  various  security issues, I have found
i    many  developers  that  do  not  follow  these best practices,"
i    Smitka  wrote.  Smitka queried 230 million websites to discover
i    the  390,000  allowing  access  to  their .git directories. The
i    vast  majority of the websites with open directories had a .com
i    TLD with .net, .de, .org and uk comprising most of the others.
