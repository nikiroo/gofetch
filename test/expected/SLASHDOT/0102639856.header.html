		Andrew Orlowski of The Register recounts all the gadgets supercharged with AI that he came across at IFA tradeshow last week -- and wonders what value AI brought to the table. He writes: I didn&#x27;t see a blockchain toothbrush at IFA in Berlin last week, but I&#x27;m sure there was one lurking about somewhere. With 30 vast halls to cover, I didn&#x27;t look too hard for it. But I did see many things almost as tragic that no one could miss -- AI being squeezed into almost every conceivable bit of consumer electronics. But none were convincing. If ever there was a solution looking for a problem, it&#x27;s ramming AI into gadgets to show of a company&#x27;s machine learning prowess. For the consumer it adds unreliability, cost and complexity, and the annoyance of being prompted. [...] Back to LG, which takes 2018&#x27;s prize for sticking AI into a superfluous gadget. The centrepiece of its AI efforts this year is a robot, ClOi. Put Google Assistant or Alexa on wheels, and you have ClOi. I asked the booth person what exactly ClOi could do to be told &quot;it can take notes for your shopping list.&quot; Why wasn&#x27;t this miracle of the Fourth Industrial Revolution let loose on the LG floor? I wondered -- a question answered by this account of ClOi&#x27;s debut at CES in January. Clearly things haven&#x27;t improved much -- this robot buddy was kept indoors.
