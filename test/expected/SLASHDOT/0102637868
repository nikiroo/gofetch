        You're a landlubber, I take it?
        The Atlantic waves are quite an obstacle for a 2m boat.
        Even drifting tar (and garbage) is a problem when you're that
        small.

        It is not that easy. If you just start sailing in a straight
        line, you will end up many kilometers above the sea, which is
        no good for a sail boat. If instead you point the boat
        straight at the finish line, you'll be under water for most
        of the trip. Again, not ideal for a sail boat. The earth is
        not flat, you know.

                 You are saying that as if it is a problem to hit C,
                 like it would be impossible to continue after 354
                 days. This is not the case. As long as you only care
                 about your own point of view and you're the one
                 being accelerated, you can reach as many times C as
                 you want (well, have fuel for).

                    You also have to decide what "at rest" means. A
                    year accelerating at g will put you at your

                          Would a flat earther believe in relativity

              The earth is not flat - that's just silly. When we ent
              to the moon, and we did go to the moon, we discovered

        I imagine that's true, if you have an effectively unlimited
        energy, but the terms of this contest is to build a vehicle
        less than eight feet long that can cross the Atlantic.
        That's not a lot of room to stuff with batteries or diesel
        fuel, or to cover with solar panels. And that's the whole
        point. If you could make the vehicle a hundred feet long,
        this challenge would be expensive, but easy. By making the
        boat tiny, you make the challenge affordable, but tough.
        The race has two divisions, sail powered and unlimited, but
        it's hard to see what they had in mind for propulsion by
        having an unlimited division. Possibly some
        seawater-replenished fuel cell.

              Being small means relative high strength. A solid two
              meter boat should indestructible by waves. No need to
              keep a human alive, nor to go very fast. A very basic,
              fixed, small but strong sail would do.
              Ice bergs could be a problem. Surely better to start
              further south. Longer but safer. Also need to stay out
              of shipping lanes.
              I think this could be done without a computer. Just a
              magnetic compass controlling a rudder. Occasionally it

        This is a 2 meter vessel, not a large racing hull built to be
        fast (and nothing but fast). Using the page you link to, the
        most useful comparison would be the single-handed records,
        and the one from 1987 which was about 11.5 days was in a 26
        meter hull! And this is the smallest vessel on the list. You
        are probably not going to get a 2 meter vessel to tear along
        at an average speed of 7.5 m/sec which would be needed for
        that 11.5 day crossing.

           There have been a few sailboats in the 2 meter size range
           which have made the transatlantic crossing.
           
           Hugo Vihlen aboard April Fool (1.8m) in 84 days in 1968,
           though technically he never finished since he was picked
           up by the USCG 6 miles offshore.
           Tom MacNally aboard the Vera Hugh (1.64m) in 134 days in
           1993.
           Hugo Vihlen again aboard the Father's Day (1.62m) in 115
           days in 1993.
           Tom MacNally unsuccessfully attempted the trip again
           aboard a 1.19m craft in 1998. He passed away last year.

        Also note that the world speed record for a radio-controlled
        sailing vessel (which was also 2 meters long) is [1]157.65 km
        in 23 hours 42 min [guinnessworldrecords.com] in the milder
        waters of the Mediterranean. At that world record speed in a
        small RC boat this challenge would have taken 32 days.
        So 79 days in a boat not controlled by a human, and not
        limited to a 24 hour period, in the open waters of the
        Atlantic is not so shabby. The speed made good over that
        whole journey is 40% of that 24 hour record.
