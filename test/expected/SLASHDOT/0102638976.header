i    Since   the  [1]release  of  Chrome  69  earlier  this  week  ,
i    countless  of  users  have  gone  on  social  media  and Google
i    Product  Forums  to  [2]complain about "blurry" or "fuzzy" text
i    inside Chrome . ZDNet:
i    
i    >  The  blurred  font issue isn't only limited to text rendered
i    inside   a  web  page,  users  said,  but  also  for  the  text
i    suggestions  displayed inside the address bar search drop-down,
i    and   Chrome's   Developer  Tools  panel.  [...]  According  to
i    reports,  the  issue  only  manifests  for  Chrome  69 users on
i    Windows.  Those  who  rolled  back  to Chrome 68 stopped having
i    problems.  Users  said  that changing Chrome, operating system,
i    or  screen DPI settings didn't help. "Our team is investigating
i    reports  of  this  behavior.  You  can find more information in
i    this  public bug report," a Google spokesperson said last night
i    after first user complaints started surfacing online.
i    
i    Some  users  have  also  expressed  concerns  over  Chrome  not
i    showing  [3]"trivial  subdomains" including www and secure lock
i    sign in the address bar.
