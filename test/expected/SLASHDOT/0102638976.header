i    Since  the release of Chrome 69 earlier this week, countless of
i    users  have  gone  on social media and Google Product Forums to
i    complain  about  "blurry" or "fuzzy" text inside Chrome. ZDNet:
i    The  blurred  font  issue  isn't  only limited to text rendered
i    inside   a  web  page,  users  said,  but  also  for  the  text
i    suggestions  displayed inside the address bar search drop-down,
i    and   Chrome's   Developer  Tools  panel.  [...]  According  to
i    reports,  the  issue  only  manifests  for  Chrome  69 users on
i    Windows.  Those  who  rolled  back  to Chrome 68 stopped having
i    problems.  Users  said  that changing Chrome, operating system,
i    or  screen DPI settings didn't help. "Our team is investigating
i    reports  of  this  behavior.  You  can find more information in
i    this  public bug report," a Google spokesperson said last night
i    after  first  user  complaints  started  surfacing online. Some
i    users  have  also  expressed  concerns  over Chrome not showing
i    "trivial  subdomains" including www and secure lock sign in the
i    address bar.
