i    Hikers,   park  rangers,  and  summer  residents  of  Iceland's
i    northernmost  peninsula  are  [1]seeking  to keep the area free
i    from  internet  service  , worrying that all that comes with it
i    "will  destroy  a  way  of  life that depends on the absence of
i    [email,  news,  and  social  media],"  reports  the  Associated
i    Press.  "The area has long resisted cell towers, but commercial
i    initiatives  could  take  the decision out of Icelanders' hands
i    and  push  Hornstrandir  across  the  digital divide." From the
i    report:
i    
i    >  Despite or because of its remoteness, Iceland ranks first on
i    a  U.N.  index comparing nations by information technology use,
i    with  roughly  98 percent of the population using the internet.
i    Among  adults,  93  percent report having Facebook accounts and
i    two-thirds  are Snapchat users, according to pollster MMR. Many
i    people  who  live  in  northwestern Iceland or visit as outdoor
i    enthusiasts  want  Hornstrandir's  570  square  kilometers (220
i    square  miles),  which  accounts  for  0.6 percent of Iceland's
i    land  mass,  to  be  declared  a  "digital-free zone." The idea
i    hasn't  coalesced  into  a petition or formal campaign, so what
i    it  would require or prohibit hasn't been fleshed out. The last
i    full-time  resident of the rugged area moved away in 1952 -- it
i    never  was  an  easy place to farm -- but many descendants have
i    turned family farmsteads into summer getaways.
i    
i    Northwest     Iceland's     representative,     Halla     Signy
i    Kristjansdottir,  is  in  favor  of  adding cell towers for the
i    safety  of  sailors  and  travelers  in  the area. "I don't see
i    anything  romantic  about  lying  on  the  ground with a broken
i    thigh  bone  and  no cellphone signal," Kristjansdottir said in
i    an interview.
