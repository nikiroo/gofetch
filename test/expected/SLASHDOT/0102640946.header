i    An anonymous reader quotes a report from Motherboard:
i    
i    >  Wednesday,  Valve, the company that operates the huge online
i    video  game  store  Steam,  shared more details about [1]how it
i    plans  to  control  and  moderate the ever-increasing number of
i    games  published  on  its  platform  . In the post [2]published
i    Wednesday  ,  Valve shared more details about how it determines
i    what  it  considers "outright trolling." "It is vague and we'll
i    tell  you  why," Valve wrote. "You're a denizen of the internet
i    so  you  know that trolls come in all forms. On Steam, some are
i    simply  trying to rile people up with something we call 'a game
i    shaped  object'  (ie:  a  crudely  made  piece of software that
i    technically  and  just  barely  passes our bar as a functioning
i    video game but isn't what 99.9% of folks would say is "good.")
i    
i    >
i    
i    >  Valve goes on to explain that some trolls are trying to scam
i    folks  out  of  their Steam inventory items (digital items that
i    can  be  traded  for  real  money),  while others are trying to
i    generate  a  small amount of money through a variety of schemes
i    that  have  to  do with how developers use keys to unlock Steam
i    games,  while  others  are  trying to "incite and sow discord."
i    "Trolls  are  figuring out new ways to be loathsome as we write
i    this,"  Valve  said.  "But the thing these folks have in common
i    is  that  they aren't actually interested in good faith efforts
i    to  make  and  sell  games to you or anyone. When a developer's
i    motives   aren't   that,   they're   probably   a  troll."  One
i    interesting  observation  Valve shares in the blog post is that
i    it  rarely  bans  individual  games  from Steam, and more often
i    bans  developers  and/or  publishers entirely. [...] Valve said
i    that  its  review process for determining that something may be
i    a   "troll   game"   is   a  "deep  assessment"  that  involves
i    investigating  who  the  developer is, what they've done in the
i    past,  their  behavior  on Steam as a developer, as a customer,
i    their  banking information, developers they associate with, and
i    more.
