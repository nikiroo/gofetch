		For all the wishful thinking about manufacturing more laptops and iPhones in the U.S., there is one sector of tech manufacturing where America remains a leader: computer chips. From a report: Some $44 billion worth of semiconductors are exported from the U.S. each year, making them America&#x27;s fourth leading manufacturing export after cars, airplanes and refined oil. There are roughly 80 wafer fabrication plants (aka fabs) in the U.S., spread across 19 states. [...] An even greater share of the world&#x27;s computer chips are designed domestically and made overseas by companies including Qualcomm, Apple, Broadcom and Nvidia. A bunch of the high-tech gear needed to produce chips is also designed and/or made in the U.S.

I'd compare it to going from just making engine blocks to making a whole car, but that underplays the difficulty too much.</p></div>

It will be interesting to see what politicians do when they realize that the best digital chips can no longer be manufactured in the US. The choice seems to be either (1) have our economy -- everything from cell phones to missiles -- dependent on chips manufactured overseas, or (2) subsidize Intel's foundry business and the semiconductor equipment manufacturers to the tune of tens of $billions, just to keep a US source of high-performance semiconductors.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>[1] https://www.samsungfoundry.com/foundry/homepage.do</p><p>[2] http://www.tsmc.com/english/default.htm</p><p>[3] https://www.anandtech.com/show/13277/globalfoundries-stops-all-7nm-development</p><p>[4] https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/overview.html</p></div>
