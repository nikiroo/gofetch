i    MAXOMENOS  writes:  EVE  Online  developer  CCP  Games has been
i    acquired  by  Pearl  Abyss,  the South Korean studio behind the
i    action-oriented   MMORPG  Black  Desert  Online.  According  to
i    VentureBeat,  the deal was worth $425 million and will close in
i    early  October. It's a surprise announcement for CCP, which has
i    long  operated  as  an  independent developer. Eve Online isn't
i    the  biggest  MMORPG  on  the  market,  but it has maintained a
i    steady  and  loyal  userbase  through  continuous updates and a
i    well-timed  switch  to a hybrid premium and free-to-play model.
i    The  15-year-old  game  is  unique,  too,  with its large-scale
i    battles   and   notoriously   complex  economic  and  political
i    systems.
