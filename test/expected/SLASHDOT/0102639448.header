i    >  developer  CCP  Games  [2]has been acquired by Pearl Abyss ,
i    the  South  Korean  studio  behind  the  action-oriented MMORPG
i    Black  Desert  Online.  According  to [3]VentureBeat , the deal
i    was  worth $425 million and will close in early October. It's a
i    surprise  announcement  for  CCP, which has long operated as an
i    independent  developer.  Eve Online isn't the biggest MMORPG on
i    the  market,  but it has maintained a steady and loyal userbase
i    through  continuous updates and a well-timed switch to a hybrid
i    premium   and  free-to-play  model.  The  15-year-old  game  is
i    unique,  too,  with  its  large-scale  battles  and notoriously
i    complex economic and political systems.
