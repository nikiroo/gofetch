i    Earlier  today, British Airways said credit card information of
i    at  least  380,000  customers have been "compromised" in a data
i    breach  that  occurred  between  August 21 and September 5. The
i    information  stolen  includes  customer names, email addresses,
i    home  addresses  and payment card information -- but not travel
i    or  passport details. Sky News reports: In an email to affected
i    customers,  BA said: "We're deeply sorry, but you may have been
i    affected.  We  recommend  that  you contact your bank or credit
i    card  provider and follow their recommended advice. We take the
i    protection  of your personal information very seriously. Please
i    accept  our  deepest  apologies for the worry and inconvenience
i    that  this  criminal  activity has caused." The breach has been
i    "resolved"  and  the website is "working normally," it said. In
i    a  statement,  the  airline added: "We have notified the police
i    and  relevant  authorities...  [and]  will continue to keep our
i    customers  updated with the very latest information. We will be
i    contacting   customers   and  will  manage  any  claims  on  an
i    individual basis."
