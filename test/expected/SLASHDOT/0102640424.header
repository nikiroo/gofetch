i    A  28-year-old  MIT  graduate  named  You  Wu  spent  six years
i    developing  a  low-cost  robot  designed to find leaks in pipes
i    early,  both  to  save  water  and to avoid bigger damage later
i    from  bursting water mains. "Called Lighthouse, the robot looks
i    like  a  badminton  birdie,"  reports  Fast  Company.  "A  soft
i    'skirt'  on  the  device is covered with sensors. As it travels
i    through  pipes, propelled by the flowing water, suction tugs at
i    the  device  when  there's a leak, and it records the location,
i    making  a  map  of critical leaks to fix." From the report: MIT
i    doctoral  student You Wu spent six years developing the design,
i    building  on  research  that  earlier  students  began  under a
i    project  sponsored  by a university in Saudi Arabia, where most
i    drinking  water  comes  from  expensive desalination plants and
i    around  a  third  of  it  is lost to leaks. It took three years
i    before  he  had  a  working  prototype. Then Wu got inspiration
i    from  an  unexpected  source:  At  a party with his partner, he
i    accidentally  stepped  on  her  dress. She noticed immediately,
i    unsurprisingly,  and  Wu  realized  that he could use a similar
i    skirt-like  design  on  a  robot so that the robot could detect
i    subtle  tugs  from  the suction at each leak. Wu graduated from
i    MIT  in  June,  and  is  now launching the technology through a
i    startup  called  WatchTower  Robotics.  The  company  will soon
i    begin  pilots in Australia and in Cambridge, Massachusetts. One
i    challenge  now, he says, is creating a guide so water companies
i    can use the device on their own.
