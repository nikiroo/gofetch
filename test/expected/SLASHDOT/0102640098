    An anonymous reader quotes a report from CNBC:
    
    >   As   our  global  economy  increasingly  comes  to  run  on
    technology-enabled  rails  and  every  company  becomes  a tech
    company,  demand  for  high-quality software engineers is at an
    all-time  high.  A  recent study from [1]Stripe and Harris Poll
    found  that  61 percent of C-suite executives believe access to
    developer  talent is a threat to the success of their business.
    Perhaps  more  surprisingly  --  as  we mark a decade after the
    financial  crisis  --  [2]this  threat  was  even  ranked above
    capital   constraints   .   And   yet,   despite   being   many
    corporations'  most  precious  resource,  developer talents are
    all  too  often  squandered. Collectively, companies today lose
    upward  of $300 billion a year paying down "technical debt," as
    developers   pour  time  into  maintaining  legacy  systems  or
    dealing  with  the  ramifications  of  bad  software.  This  is
    especially  worrisome,  given  the  outsized  impact developers
    have  on  companies'  chances  of  success. Software developers
    don't  have a monopoly on good ideas, but their skill set makes
    them  a  uniquely  deep  source of innovation, productivity and
    new  economic  connections. When deployed correctly, developers
    can  be  economic multipliers -- coefficients that dramatically
    ratchet  up  the  output  of  the  teams and companies of which
    they're a part.

     Naa, that would be un-capitalist. Developers must be cheap
     wage-slaves that do not have a real career-path and are unable
     to find a job once they hit 50. That will surely not have any
     impact on whether smart people go into software writing or not,

              And there you are wrong. I have a pretty good career
              myself. But I see how many coders are treated and I am
              not surprised at all that there are by far not enough

                 coders, the issue of "not enough good ones" isn't
                 because of that. There's only so many smart people,
                 dumb people and mediocre people don't make good

        It won't really have any impact, because young people don't
        think they'll ever get old. Or it will be different for them.
        Had a 20-something at my last job make a number of comments
        about some of the older developers there, saying they'd hate
        to still be working at that age, and that they are probably
        stuck doing the same work because they can't learn anything
        new. I don't know why he was telling me this, as I was twice
        his age at the time, but it's obvious that he doesn't think
        he'll be in the same position.
        They ultimately did lay off a lot of their senior engineers
        and replace a lot of the position with 20-somethings,
        including in project management positions. A number of those
        projects never saw the light of day after years of re-writes
        into new frameworks.

        I've quit one job and refused two others because of open
        offices. The two I refused were absolutely flabbergasted by
        my refusal. They literally could not understand why anyone
        wouldn't want to be in an open office space surrounded on 3.8
        sides by glass-walled manager offices, loud ugly marketing
        girls, and a bunch of H1B dudes who couldn't be bothered to
        wear deodorant. That place (MX Logic) had the worst looking
        office I've ever seen. One of them offered me the job on the
        spot after the interview and I was already shutting them down
        and refusing it before they even got started. I told them
        there is about a zero percent chance of getting anyone really
        talented to take the gig, because they had this ridiculous
        noisy slave pit thing going. I nearly left before I even
        *did* the interview I was so disgusted with the place. The
        hiring manager was (of course) offended, but he was also
        clueless. About a year after that interview I had a guy come
        up to me at the local Maker Space who was one of the
        "technical resources" for the company during the interview
        (quiet guy in the back of the room). He told me "My god was I
        cheering when you refused them over the goddamn open
        workspace idiocy. My boss was upset over that for weeks. They
        still talk about it during the hiring process and argue about
        it."

           I get recruiters wanting to submit me all the time. Then
           after a week, I follow up and the "the position is
           closed." I think recruiters are assholes who got fired
           from see car lots for ethics violations.
           So, when you get a real job with health insurance, you'll
           be an outlier.
           Of course, that's assumimg you're not full of shit.

              I agree; I regard recruiters as people that weren't
              ethical enough to get jobs as used car salesmen. I
              interviewed for a job once, didn't get any response, so
              I started another position. A month after the initial
              interview, the recruiter for the first position offered
              me $1500 cash in a plain, unmarked envelope to quit the
              job I'd just started and take the other position
              instead! (Apparently the cash came out of his
              commission.) So yes, recruiters know nothing, rely

     It's like saying "gold is worth more than money!" - totally
     meaningless.
     One (gold, developers) is a commodity that IS exchanged, the
     other (money) is the medium OF exchange.
     Saying that "commodity X" is worth more than "exchange medium Y"
     makes no sense because a commodity CANNOT be worth "more" or
     "less" than the medium of exchange used - it can only ever be
     worth a specified amount of Y.

     No where does it say that companies think developers are more
     important than money.
     The results state that the companies perceive the risk of not
     being able to find skills as higher than the risks of not being
     able to access capital.
     This is especially true if you're a cash rich organisation.
     In the current financial climate finding returns on your
     investments is hard. Interest rates are at historically low
     levels, bond returns are zero, and so that leaves higher risk

     Incurring technical debt is a business decision.
     And it may well be the right decision.
     For example, in a startup, time to market typically trumps
