		The Tor Browser has rolled out a new interface with the release of v8. From a report: The Tor Browser has always been based on the Firefox codebase, but it lagged behind a few releases. Mozilla rolled out a major overhaul of the Firefox codebase in November 2017, with the release of Firefox 57, the first release in the Firefox Quantum series. Firefox Quantum came with a new page rendering engine, a new add-ons API, and a new user interface called the Photon UI. Because these were major, code-breaking changes, it took the smaller Tor team some time to integrate all of them into the Tor Browser codebase and make sure everything worked as intended. The new Tor Browser 8, released yesterday, is now in sync with the most recent version of Firefox, the Quantum release, and also supports all of its features. This means the Tor Browser now uses the same modern Photon UI that current Firefox versions use, it supports the same speed-optimized page rendering engine and has also dropped support for the old XUL-based add-ons system for the new WebExtensions API system used by Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi, Brave, and the rest of the Chromium browsers.

    <div class='comment_content'><p></p><p>I really wonder that. I support tor. I've never actually used it because I don't have much to hide, but I understand that other do. So I ran a tor relay (not exit) as my way of supporting the project for a while; from my home adsl. After a while I noticed some weird stuff going on. Some websites (important ones) wouldn't load properly. Emails sent would bounce or simply never reach their destination. After looking at the problem I found that my IP was on some minor blacklists. I stopped the relay and after 2 days I was off the blacklists. Hence my question, if running a simple relay gets you blacklisted, what does running an exit point does to your other internet usage from that IP ? Who can afford separate IPs besides institutions ? So who is really really running them ? Certainly not private citizens...</p></div>
