    Andrew  Orlowski  of  The  Register  recounts  all  the gadgets
    supercharged  with AI that he came across at IFA tradeshow last
    week  --  and  wonders  what  value AI brought to the table. He
    writes:  I  didn't see a blockchain toothbrush at IFA in Berlin
    last  week, but I'm sure there was one lurking about somewhere.
    With  30  vast  halls  to cover, I didn't look too hard for it.
    But  I  did  see many things almost as tragic that no one could
    miss  -- AI being squeezed into almost every conceivable bit of
    consumer  electronics.  But none were convincing. If ever there
    was  a  solution  looking  for  a problem, it's ramming AI into
    gadgets  to  show  of a company's machine learning prowess. For
    the  consumer  it  adds unreliability, cost and complexity, and
    the  annoyance of being prompted. [...] Back to LG, which takes
    2018's  prize  for  sticking  AI into a superfluous gadget. The
    centrepiece  of  its AI efforts this year is a robot, ClOi. Put
    Google  Assistant  or  Alexa  on  wheels,  and you have ClOi. I
    asked  the  booth  person what exactly ClOi could do to be told
    "it  can  take  notes  for your shopping list." Why wasn't this
    miracle  of  the  Fourth Industrial Revolution let loose on the
    LG  floor? I wondered -- a question answered by this account of
    ClOi's   debut  at  CES  in  January.  Clearly  things  haven't
    improved much -- this robot buddy was kept indoors.

           looking back at negative guesses is we only really

           evidence is in modern use today, while all the naysayers

              The naysayers were right about the Segway, but that was

              Success of a technology is rarely correlated with the
              success of particular companies. Silicon Valley is
              littered with plaques marking the graves of
              semiconductor pioneering companies. Few of them
              survived. Yet semiconductors have been the greatest
              technological success since fire was tamed.
              For another example, look at aviation. It took 66 years
              to go from Kitty Hawk to the Sea of Tranquility. Yet
              how many airlines made money during those years? Almost
              none.

           Considering they only have partial skills in technology

        It was the 1980s. It had faded long before 1990.
        But there was an earlier AI craze in the 1960s, based on
        perceptrons. That faded by 1970.
        The 1980 AI hype cycle was driven by "expert systems" and
        "Lisp machines".
        The latest cycle started in 2006 with the publication of the
        [1]seminal paper on deep learning [sciencemag.org], and has

           AI had an unambiguous definition that eroded under stress

              Learning Lisp would not have helped you. Modern AI uses

        Even though I don't routinely use my phone as an alarm clock,
        it still knows when i'm likely to get up and if I plug it in
        at bed time it'll do a good job of figuring out when i'm
        likely to get up and adjusts its charging rate to be done
        about an hour before then. Yet if I plug it in a 3pm then
        it'll assume i want as much charge as possible and charge as
        fast as it can. It's not rocket science, but it's useful.

           Printers have a screen. You can't talk to it (at least
           you're not supposed to--when aggravated, I've been know to
           do so, and not kindly). But try to decipher what's on that
           screen. I claim that printers are not any easier to use
           than they were in 1984 (which is when I got my first dot
           matrix printer). You (ok, I) *still* can't figure out
           what's wrong with them, despite the screen.

           They do actually.
           Roombas have to be able to adapt to unknown obstacles and
           uncertain sensory input (could get blocked, partially
           occluded etc...).
           Embedded fuzzy logic controllers (also used in anti-lock
           brakes) have to be able to maintain a steady output signal
           given uncertain input (wear and tear on the mechanics,
           grit...) that can vary wildly in an unknown manner.
           OCR systems need to be able to tell the difference between
           a cheque and unknown things, like night club flyers, and
           they deal with hand written

     AI (i.e. machine learning/neural networks) is really good at

     hundreds of thousands of entities in a system. Examples are the
     electricity grid, playing Go, and a department store's

     In our individual lives, AI seems more like another drop in the

        the ratio 1s more than 10 to 1 SPAM to worth while messages
