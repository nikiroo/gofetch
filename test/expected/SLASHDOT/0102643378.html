		Earlier today, British Airways said [1]credit card information of at least 380,000 customers have been &quot;compromised&quot; in a data breach that occurred between August 21 and September 5. The information stolen includes customer names, email addresses, home addresses and payment card information -- but not travel or passport details. Sky News reports:<br/><br/>&gt; In an email to affected customers, BA said: &quot;We&#x27;re deeply sorry, but you may have been affected. We recommend that you contact your bank or credit card provider and follow their recommended advice. We take the protection of your personal information very seriously. Please accept our deepest apologies for the worry and inconvenience that this criminal activity has caused.&quot; The breach has been &quot;resolved&quot; and the website is &quot;working normally,&quot; it said. In a statement, the airline added: &quot;We have notified the police and relevant authorities... [and] will continue to keep our customers updated with the very latest information. We will be contacting customers and will manage any claims on an individual basis.&quot;<br/><br/><br/><br/>[1] https://news.sky.com/story/ba-calls-in-police-over-customer-data-theft-from-website-11491980
