i  from the for-the-record dept.

i    The  Tor  Browser  has  [1]rolled  out a new interface with the
i    release of v8 . From a report:
i    
i    >  The  Tor  Browser  has  always  been  based  on  the Firefox
i    codebase,  but  it lagged behind a few releases. Mozilla rolled
i    out  a major overhaul of the Firefox codebase in November 2017,
i    with  the  release  of  Firefox 57, [2]the first release in the
i    Firefox  Quantum  series . Firefox Quantum came with a new page
i    rendering  engine,  a new add-ons API, and a new user interface
i    called  the  Photon UI. Because these were major, code-breaking
i    changes,  it  took  the smaller Tor team some time to integrate
i    all  of  them  into  the  Tor  Browser  codebase  and make sure
i    everything  worked as intended. The new Tor Browser 8, released
i    yesterday,  is  now  in  sync  with  the most recent version of
i    Firefox,  the  Quantum  release,  and  also supports all of its
i    features.  This  means the Tor Browser now uses the same modern
i    Photon  UI  that  current Firefox versions use, it supports the
i    same   speed-optimized  page  rendering  engine  and  has  also
i    dropped  support  for  the old XUL-based add-ons system for the
i    new  WebExtensions  API  system used by Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi,
i    Brave, and the rest of the Chromium browsers.
