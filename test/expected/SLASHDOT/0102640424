    A  28-year-old  MIT  graduate  named  You  Wu  spent  six years
    [1]developing  a low-cost robot designed to find leaks in pipes
    early  ,  both  to  save water and to avoid bigger damage later
    from  bursting water mains. "Called Lighthouse, the robot looks
    like  a  badminton  birdie,"  reports  Fast  Company.  "A  soft
    'skirt'  on  the  device is covered with sensors. As it travels
    through  pipes, propelled by the flowing water, suction tugs at
    the  device  when  there's a leak, and it records the location,
    making a map of critical leaks to fix." From the report:
    
    >  MIT  doctoral  student You Wu spent six years developing the
    design,  building on research that earlier students began under
    a  project  sponsored  by  a  university in Saudi Arabia, where
    most  drinking  water  comes from expensive desalination plants
    and  around a third of it is lost to leaks. It took three years
    before  he  had  a  working  prototype. Then Wu got inspiration
    from  an  unexpected  source:  At  a party with his partner, he
    accidentally  stepped  on  her  dress. She noticed immediately,
    unsurprisingly,  and  Wu  realized  that he could use a similar
    skirt-like  design  on  a  robot so that the robot could detect
    subtle  tugs  from  the suction at each leak. Wu graduated from
    MIT  in  June,  and  is  now launching the technology through a
    startup  called  [2]WatchTower Robotics . The company will soon
    begin  pilots in Australia and in Cambridge, Massachusetts. One
    challenge  now, he says, is creating a guide so water companies
    can use the device on their own.

        Ridiculous, how dare you plebeians libel our foremost
        technology elite. It's MIT, of course what they're doing is
        utterly novel and deserving of fawning media coverage.

     I hear they tried that robot in Montreal and it crashed due to
     memory exhaustion.
     Montreal is one of the oldest city in North America and there
     are so many leaks in its water system that it loses 30% of its
     fresh water supply.
     Makes you wonder what is the average water loss in other systems.
