i    The  Microtransat  has  been running since 2010 and has seen 23
i    previous  entries  all  fail  to make it across. The successful
i    boat,  SB  Met  was  built  by  the  Norwegian company Offshore
i    Sensing  AS  and  is  only 2 metres (6.5 ft) long. It completed
i    the  crossing  on August 26th, 79 days and 5000 km (3100 miles)
i    of  sailing  after  departing Newfoundland on June 7th. Further
