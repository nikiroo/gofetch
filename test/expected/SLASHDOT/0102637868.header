i    running  since  2010  and has seen 23 previous entries all fail
i    to  make it across. The successful boat, [3]SB Met was built by
i    the  Norwegian  company  [4]Offshore  Sensing  AS and is only 2
i    metres  (6.5  ft)  long.  It  completed  the crossing on August
i    26th,  79  days  and  5000  km  (3100  miles)  of sailing after
i    departing Newfoundland on June 7th.
