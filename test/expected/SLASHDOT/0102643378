    Earlier  today, British Airways said [1]credit card information
    of  at  least  380,000  customers  have been "compromised" in a
    data  breach  that  occurred between August 21 and September 5.
    The   information   stolen   includes   customer  names,  email
    addresses,  home  addresses and payment card information -- but
    not travel or passport details. Sky News reports:
    
    >  In  an  email  to affected customers, BA said: "We're deeply
    sorry,  but  you  may have been affected. We recommend that you
    contact  your  bank  or  credit  card provider and follow their
    recommended  advice.  We  take  the protection of your personal
    information   very   seriously.   Please   accept  our  deepest
    apologies  for  the  worry and inconvenience that this criminal
    activity  has  caused."  The breach has been "resolved" and the
    website  is  "working  normally,"  it said. In a statement, the
    airline  added:  "We  have  notified  the  police  and relevant
    authorities...  [and]  will  continue  to  keep  our  customers
    updated   with   the   very  latest  information.  We  will  be
    contacting   customers   and  will  manage  any  claims  on  an
    individual basis."

     Say, $100 per customer, payable to the customer for their
     hassle. But likely this will not cost them a thing. So it will
     happen again and again and again.

     ... years, the universe was in an expanding opaque plasma state
     so dense that photons could not travel very far.
     Coincidence?
     Yes, I'm sure of it.

     "We take the protection of your personal information very
     seriously" Almost insulting to put that in the email sent to
     affected clients.
