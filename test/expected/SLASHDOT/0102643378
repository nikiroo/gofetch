    Earlier  today, British Airways said credit card information of
    at  least  380,000  customers have been "compromised" in a data
    breach  that  occurred  between  August 21 and September 5. The
    information  stolen  includes  customer names, email addresses,
    home  addresses  and payment card information -- but not travel
    or  passport details. Sky News reports: In an email to affected
    customers,  BA said: "We're deeply sorry, but you may have been
    affected.  We  recommend  that  you contact your bank or credit
    card  provider and follow their recommended advice. We take the
    protection  of your personal information very seriously. Please
    accept  our  deepest  apologies for the worry and inconvenience
    that  this  criminal  activity has caused." The breach has been
    "resolved"  and  the website is "working normally," it said. In
    a  statement,  the  airline added: "We have notified the police
    and  relevant  authorities...  [and]  will continue to keep our
    customers  updated with the very latest information. We will be
    contacting   customers   and  will  manage  any  claims  on  an
    individual basis."

     Say, $100 per customer, payable to the customer for their
     hassle. But likely this will not cost them a thing. So it will
     happen again and again and again.

     Coincidence?
     Yes, I'm sure of it.

     -Sigh-.
     This is why we can’t have nice things.

     "We take the protection of your personal information very
     seriously" Almost insulting to put that in the email sent to
     affected clients.
