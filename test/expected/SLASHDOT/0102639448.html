		MAXOMENOS writes: EVE Online developer CCP Games has been acquired by Pearl Abyss, the South Korean studio behind the action-oriented MMORPG Black Desert Online. According to VentureBeat, the deal was worth $425 million and will close in early October. It&#x27;s a surprise announcement for CCP, which has long operated as an independent developer. Eve Online isn&#x27;t the biggest MMORPG on the market, but it has maintained a steady and loyal userbase through continuous updates and a well-timed switch to a hybrid premium and free-to-play model. The 15-year-old game is unique, too, with its large-scale battles and notoriously complex economic and political systems.

And version management? Okay, I guess the last one was a bit mean. They must have discovered Git by now.</p><p>But seriously, the game is an unstructured mess. Played it for a while, flew a Machariel and did incursions, level 4 missions etc. but after a while it got boring. May pick it up again though.</p></div>
