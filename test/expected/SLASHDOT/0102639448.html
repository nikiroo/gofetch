		[1]MAXOMENOS writes:<br/><br/>&gt;<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; EVE Online<br/><br/>&gt; developer CCP Games [2]has been acquired by Pearl Abyss , the South Korean studio behind the action-oriented MMORPG Black Desert Online. According to [3]VentureBeat , the deal was worth $425 million and will close in early October. It&#x27;s a surprise announcement for CCP, which has long operated as an independent developer. Eve Online isn&#x27;t the biggest MMORPG on the market, but it has maintained a steady and loyal userbase through continuous updates and a well-timed switch to a hybrid premium and free-to-play model. The 15-year-old game is unique, too, with its large-scale battles and notoriously complex economic and political systems.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[1] https://slashdot.org/~MAXOMENOS<br/><br/>[2] https://www.ccpgames.com/news/2018/black-desert-online-creators-pearl-abyss-to-acquire-ccp-games-makers-of-eve<br/><br/>[3] https://venturebeat.com/2018/09/06/black-desert-online-creator-pearl-abyss-acquires-eve-online-maker-ccp-games-for-425-million/

And version management? Okay, I guess the last one was a bit mean. They must have discovered Git by now.</p><p>But seriously, the game is an unstructured mess.
