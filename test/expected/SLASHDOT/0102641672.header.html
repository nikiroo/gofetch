		Hikers, park rangers, and summer residents of Iceland&#x27;s northernmost peninsula are seeking to keep the area free from internet service, worrying that all that comes with it &quot;will destroy a way of life that depends on the absence of [email, news, and social media],&quot; reports the Associated Press. &quot;The area has long resisted cell towers, but commercial initiatives could take the decision out of Icelanders&#x27; hands and push Hornstrandir across the digital divide.&quot; From the report: Despite or because of its remoteness, Iceland ranks first on a U.N. index comparing nations by information technology use, with roughly 98 percent of the population using the internet. Among adults, 93 percent report having Facebook accounts and two-thirds are Snapchat users, according to pollster MMR. Many people who live in northwestern Iceland or visit as outdoor enthusiasts want Hornstrandir&#x27;s 570 square kilometers (220 square miles), which accounts for 0.6 percent of Iceland&#x27;s land mass, to be declared a &quot;digital-free zone.&quot; The idea hasn&#x27;t coalesced into a petition or formal campaign, so what it would require or prohibit hasn&#x27;t been fleshed out. The last full-time resident of the rugged area moved away in 1952 -- it never was an easy place to farm -- but many descendants have turned family farmsteads into summer getaways. Northwest Iceland&#x27;s representative, Halla Signy Kristjansdottir, is in favor of adding cell towers for the safety of sailors and travelers in the area. &quot;I don&#x27;t see anything romantic about lying on the ground with a broken thigh bone and no cellphone signal,&quot; Kristjansdottir said in an interview.
