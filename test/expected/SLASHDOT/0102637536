    The  Tor  Browser  has  [1]rolled  out a new interface with the
    release of v8 . From a report:
    
    >  The  Tor  Browser  has  always  been  based  on  the Firefox
    codebase,  but  it lagged behind a few releases. Mozilla rolled
    out  a major overhaul of the Firefox codebase in November 2017,
    with  the  release  of  Firefox 57, [2]the first release in the
    Firefox  Quantum  series . Firefox Quantum came with a new page
    rendering  engine,  a new add-ons API, and a new user interface
    called  the  Photon UI. Because these were major, code-breaking
    changes,  it  took  the smaller Tor team some time to integrate
    all  of  them  into  the  Tor  Browser  codebase  and make sure
    everything  worked as intended. The new Tor Browser 8, released
    yesterday,  is  now  in  sync  with  the most recent version of
    Firefox,  the  Quantum  release,  and  also supports all of its
    features.  This  means the Tor Browser now uses the same modern
    Photon  UI  that  current Firefox versions use, it supports the
    same   speed-optimized  page  rendering  engine  and  has  also
    dropped  support  for  the old XUL-based add-ons system for the
    new  WebExtensions  API  system used by Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi,
    Brave, and the rest of the Chromium browsers.

        Not when you have the assets already cached. Most people
        donâ(TM)t just visit a site once. I was playing with it this

        The point is to be synced up to the current Firefox codebase.
        Which by the way is awesome. I have all my favorite
        extensions running, in spite of all the FUD about the new
        Webextensions API.

                 It is FUD. Firefox's extension ecology is as vibrant
                 as ever, but far more secure. And if somebody
                 disagrees, they should do so instead of taking the
                 belly slither route.

                       You can use the built-in [1]Reader View
                       [mozilla.org] for a lot of pages, but it's not
                       available for all pages. It depends on the
                       page structure.

     First impression is I like it. Video playback seems sluggish but

  ** Who can afford to run a tor exit node ? (Score:4, Interesting)

     I really wonder that. I support tor. I've never actually used it
     because I don't have much to hide, but I understand that other
     do. So I ran a tor relay (not exit) as my way of supporting the
     project for a while; from my home adsl. After a while I noticed
     some weird stuff going on. Some websites (important ones)
     wouldn't load properly. Emails sent would bounce or simply never
     reach their destination. After looking at the problem I found
     that my IP was on some minor blacklists. I stopped the relay and
     after 2 days I was off the blacklists. Hence my question, if
     running a simple relay gets you blacklisted, what does running
     an exit point does to your other internet usage from that IP ?
     Who can afford separate IPs besides institutions ? So who is
     really really running them ? Certainly not private citizens...

        You can run something like a Linode instance pretty cheaply
        and get more IPs. I've run a highly restricted exit node in
        the past (low bandwidth, select ports), and I've had the same
        problems with you if I try to use my Linode as a web proxy.
        My most recent problem has been with Shut Up and Sit Down RSS
        feeds, which are blocking my host  :-\

           And that's just because no matter how noble the cause,
           idiots will just ruin it. You don't need a list of Tor
           exit nodes because if you run a reasonably popular
           website, you'll find out quite rapidly what they are and
           auto-blacklist t hem.
           It's why CDNs like CloudFlare block Tor - the abuse from
           Tor exit nodes ensures that whatever trigger you use,
           it'll be triggered and you'll end up blocking it. It's not
           like it's done deliberately - you don't have to seek out
           new Tor exit nodes. They just make themselves known.
           I'd even venture to say if you want to allow Tor traffic,
           you have to whitelist them specifically It's not that Tor
           is bad, it's just that it's got a bunch of bad actors that
           really do ruin it for those who need it.

              I should mention that I don't and never did allow
              access on port 80 or 443, yet Shut up and Sit Down's
              RSS feed blocks me. There is no way my host was causing
              issues for their site, with the 20 KB/s of bandwidth I
              allowed. Additionally, I only allowed ports like IRC,
              DN

        NSA, CIA, GCHQ did not worry about anonymous communication.
        Police with lots of cash per investigation at a national
        level don't worry about anonymous communication anymore.
