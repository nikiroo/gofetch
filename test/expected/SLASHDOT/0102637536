    The  Tor  Browser  has  rolled  out  a  new  interface with the
    release  of  v8. From a report: The Tor Browser has always been
    based  on  the  Firefox  codebase,  but  it lagged behind a few
    releases.  Mozilla  rolled  out a major overhaul of the Firefox
    codebase  in November 2017, with the release of Firefox 57, the
    first  release  in  the Firefox Quantum series. Firefox Quantum
    came  with  a new page rendering engine, a new add-ons API, and
    a  new  user interface called the Photon UI. Because these were
    major,  code-breaking  changes,  it  took  the smaller Tor team
    some  time  to  integrate  all  of  them  into  the Tor Browser
    codebase  and  make sure everything worked as intended. The new
    Tor  Browser  8,  released  yesterday,  is now in sync with the
    most  recent  version of Firefox, the Quantum release, and also
    supports  all  of  its features. This means the Tor Browser now
    uses  the  same  modern Photon UI that current Firefox versions
    use,  it  supports  the  same  speed-optimized  page  rendering
    engine  and  has  also  dropped  support  for the old XUL-based
    add-ons  system  for  the  new WebExtensions API system used by
    Chrome,  Opera,  Vivaldi,  Brave,  and the rest of the Chromium
    browsers.

        Not when you have the assets already cached. Most people
        donâ(TM)t just visit a site once. I was playing with it this

        The point is to be synced up to the current Firefox codebase.
        Which by the way is awesome. I have all my favorite
        extensions running, in spite of all the FUD about the new
        Webextensions API.

                 It is FUD. Firefox's extension ecology is as vibrant
                 as ever, but far more secure. And if somebody
                 disagrees, they should do so instead of taking the
                 belly slither route.

                       You can use the built-in [1]Reader View
                       [mozilla.org] for a lot of pages, but it's not
                       available for all pages. It depends on the
                       page structure.

  ** Who can afford to run a tor exit node ? (Score:4, Interesting)

     I really wonder that. I support tor. I've never actually used it
     because I don't have much to hide, but I understand that other
     do. So I ran a tor relay (not exit) as my way of supporting the
     project for a while; from my home adsl. After a while I noticed
     some weird stuff going on. Some websites (important ones)
     wouldn't load properly. Emails sent would bounce or simply never
     reach their destination. After looking at the problem I found
     that my IP was on some minor blacklists. I stopped the relay and
     after 2 days I was off the blacklists. Hence my question, if
     running a simple relay gets you blacklisted, what does running
     an exit point does to your other internet usage from that IP ?
     Who can afford separate IPs besides institutions ? So who is
     really really running them ? Certainly not private citizens...

        You can run something like a Linode instance pretty cheaply
        and get more IPs. I've run a highly restricted exit node in
        the past (low bandwidth, select ports), and I've had the same
        problems with you if I try to use my Linode as a web proxy.
        My most recent problem has been with Shut Up and Sit Down RSS
        feeds, which are blocking my host  :-\

           And that's just because no matter how noble the cause,
           idiots will just ruin it. You don't need a list of Tor
           exit nodes because if you run a reasonably popular
           website, you'll find out quite rapidly what they are and
           auto-blacklist t hem.
           It's why CDNs like CloudFlare block Tor - the abuse from
           Tor exit nodes ensures that whatever trigger you use,
           it'll be triggered and you'll end up blocking it. It's not
           like it's done deliberately - you don't have to seek out
           new Tor exit nodes. They just make themselves known.
           I'd even venture to say if you want to allow Tor traffic,
           you have to whitelist them specifically It's not that Tor
           is bad, it's just that it's got a bunch of bad actors that
           really do ruin it for those who need it.

              I should mention that I don't and never did allow
              access on port 80 or 443, yet Shut up and Sit Down's
              RSS feed blocks me. There is no way my host was causing
              issues for their site, with the 20 KB/s of bandwidth I
              allowed. Additionally, I only allowed ports like IRC,
              DN

        NSA, CIA, GCHQ did not worry about anonymous communication.
        Police with lots of cash per investigation at a national
        level don't worry about anonymous communication anymore.
