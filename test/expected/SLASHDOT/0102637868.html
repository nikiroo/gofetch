The Microtransat has been running since 2010 and has seen 23 previous entries all fail to make it across. The successful boat, [3]SB Met was built by the Norwegian company [4]Offshore Sensing AS and is only 2 metres (6.5 ft) long. It completed the crossing on August 26th, 79 days and 5000 km (3100 miles) of sailing after departing Newfoundland on June 7th.<br/><br/>Further reading:  [5]A Fleet of Sailing Robots Sets Out To Quantify the Oceans .<br/><br/><br/><br/>[1] https://www.microtransat.org/<br/><br/>[2] https://www.apnews.com/f6d0e2a099684468873ab48966590ada<br/><br/>[3] https://www.microtransat.org/2018_sailbuoy_boat.php<br/><br/>[4] http://sailbuoy.no/<br/><br/>[5] https://science.slashdot.org/story/18/05/16/228245/a-fleet-of-sailing-robots-sets-out-to-quantify-the-oceans

If instead you point the boat straight at the finish line, you'll be under water for most of the trip. Again, not ideal for a sail boat. The earth is not flat, you know.</p></div>

This is not the case. As long as you only care about your own point of view and you're the one being accelerated, you can reach as many times C as you want (well, have fuel for).</p></div>

      <div class='comment_content'><p></p><p>This is a 2 meter vessel, not a large racing hull built to be fast (and nothing but fast). Using the page you link to, the most useful comparison would be the single-handed records, and the one from 1987 which was about 11.5 days was in a 26 meter hull! And this is the smallest vessel on the list. You are probably not going to get a 2 meter vessel to tear along at an average speed of 7.5 m/sec which would be needed for that 11.5 day crossing.</p></div>
