i    The  National  Academies  Press has released a 156-page report,
i    called  "  [1]Securing  the Vote: Protecting American Democracy
i    ,"  concluding  that  blockchains  are  not  safe  for the U.S.
i    election  system. "While the notion of using a blockchain as an
i    immutable  ballot box may seem promising, blockchain technology
i    does  little  to  solve  the  fundamental  security  issues  of
i    elections,   and   indeed,   blockchains  introduce  additional
i    security   vulnerabilities,"   the   report   [2]states  .  "In
i    particular,  if  malware  on  a  voter's  device  alters a vote
i    before  it  ever  reaches a blockchain, the immutability of the
i    blockchain  fails  to  provide  the  desired integrity, and the
i    voter may never know of the alteration."
i    
i    The  report goes on to say that "Blockchains do not provide the
i    anonymity  often  ascribed  to  them."  It  continues:  "In the
i    particular  context  of elections, voters need to be authorized
i    as  eligible  to  vote  and  as  not  having cast more than one
i    ballot  in  the  particular  election. Blockchains do not offer
i    means  for  providing  the  necessary authorization. [...] If a
i    blockchain  is  used,  then  cast  ballots must be encrypted or
i    otherwise  anonymized  to  prevent  coercion and vote-selling."
i    The New York Times summarizes the findings:
i    
i    >  The  cautiously  worded  report  [3]calls for conducting all
i    federal,  state  and local elections on paper ballots by 2020 .
i    Its  other top recommendation would require nationwide use of a
i    specific  form  of  routine  postelection audit to ensure votes
i    have  been  accurately counted. The panel did not offer a price
i    tag   for  its  recommended  overhaul.  New  York  University's
i    Brennan  Center  has  estimated  that  replacing  aging  voting
i    machines  over  the  next  few  years  could  cost well over $1
i    billion.  The  156-page  report  [...] bemoans a rickety system
i    compromised  by  insecure  voting  equipment and software whose
i    vulnerabilities  were  exposed more than a decade ago and which
i    are  too  often  managed  by  officials with little training in
i    cybersecurity.

i    >
i    
i    >   Among  its  specific  recommendations  was  a  mainstay  of
i    election  reformers:  All  elections  should use human-readable
i    paper  ballots  by  2020.  Such  systems are intended to assure
i    voters  that  their  vote  was  recorded  accurately. They also
i    create  a lasting record of "voter intent" that can be used for
i    reliable  recounts,  which  may not be possible in systems that
i    record  votes  electronically.  [...]  The panel also calls for
i    all  states to adopt a type of post-election audit that employs
i    statistical    analysis    of    ballots   prior   to   results
i    certification.  Such  "risk-limiting"  audits  are  designed to
i    uncover  miscounts  and  vote  tampering.  Currently only three
i    states mandate them.
