  ** PM_MOAR_NUDES
     They still didn’t fix fastdownload from community servers...

     ** Firelfyyy
        Yep still an issue for me as well... Hopefully they'll sort
        it soon.

        ** PM_MOAR_NUDES
           You know the workaround? It’s easy to use, but it’s just
           beyond me that valve hasn’t just spent five minutes fixing
           this

           ** Firelfyyy
              I think so, care to share anyway.
              Haven't actually bothered using it.

                 It’s painless to use I am out and about so I’ll
                 forget to find a link but it is shared in one of the
                 github bug tracker page for that isseu

                 ** klinch3R
                    If you remind me in like 1 hour i can post a link
                    to it.






     ** whatyourereferringto
        This update almost made me want to reinstall but I'll wait
        until this is fixed

        ** PM_MOAR_NUDES
           Oddly there is a workaround created by a guy that makes
           cheats for csgo

           ** whatyourereferringto
              I've used that before but it's a little bit pathetic
              this bug hasn't been fixed after 4+ years

              ** PM_MOAR_NUDES
                 True



           ** ericek111
              Hey, my cheats are just a proof-of-concept! :)




  ** TheSilentLink
     This is great news! It finally fixes the bug where one core was
     stuck at 100% all the time.

     ** Firelfyyy
        Fuck I have to check this out!


  ** dirtkiller23
     I had like 60 average fps(ulletical's benchmark map) on
     Scaleform,and panorama was on 45 av.fps.After this patch,i'm
     hitting constant 60 fps.

     ** Firelfyyy
        Good to know! I play c's pretty competitively so I have a
        pretty beastly gaming pc yet having slightly less fps on
        Linux than windows bothered me.

        ** Nakrule18
           I just switched from windows to Linux and have only 100FPS
           (240 before) on CSGO. Any idea what I’m doing wrong ? I
           use an Optimus laptop with the latest nvidia driver and
           bumblebee.

           ** Firelfyyy
              Make sure compositing is turned off before launching
              cs. Should do it automatically.
              Make sure you have the latest driver.
              Optimus shouldn't have such a large perf hit so maybe
              not that.
              Possibly your CPU isn't boosting as much under Linux.
              Cs is very CPU based so having high individual core
              counts can help heaps.

              ** Nakrule18
                 I will try this tonight, thank you. It is definitely
                 not a CPU issue (Razer Blade 2018 with six physical
                 cores).
                 In fact I was wondering if my laptop was using the
                 Nvidia card or the Intel IGP, as 100FPS when playing
                 CS with the lowest settings in 1024x768 should not
                 be possible with a GTX1060.

                 ** Firelfyyy
                    Individual core speeds are more important, but
                    100fps is still pretty low so you're probably
                    right there.
                    But yeah if Optimus isn't working properly that
                    sounds like a reasonable reason.

                    ** Nakrule18
                       Do you know any way to check which card is
                       being used while playing ?

                       ** Firelfyyy
                          No clue, don't play on laptops. Sorry!








  ** rebakis
     I hope so, Performance really suffered with the Panorama update.

  ** gandalfx
     Is boosting possible in casual now? That sounds dope!

     ** Firelfyyy
        Yup!


  ** jrwagh333
     Any tips for improving performance in Linux?
     I have Ryzen 1600 @3.75Ghz.
     I used to get between 250-350fps in competitive. Using Linux
     that drops down to 120-200fps
     Currently using -high as a launch option and setting the CPU
     Guvnor in Terminal to performance

  ** TurnDownForTendies
     Still getting less performance than windows but this is
     significantly better than what it used to be for me. Maps used
     to have big fps drops and now its a lot smoother.

  ** Atexrs
     What about the bug I've had for years on gnome where alt tabbing
     causes the games aspect ratio and resolution to get fucked up.

     ** jensreuterberg
        Never had that problem myself, is it only on GNOME? And do
        you set resolution in like launch options?


     ** gandalfx
        The comment symbolizes everything I hate about the CSGO
        community: Always complaining. Valve could do nothing even a
        fraction as horrible as the constant bitching of people who
        want everything different but nothing changed.

        ** headless_cyborg
           I like every CSGO update, it always makes something
           better. I don't think I ever had a reason to complain. The
           best update was adding Linux support in 2014 of course :)


        ** jensreuterberg
           Or obsessing about gambling and pro teams or pro's doing
           things you'd expect pro's would do instead of talking
           about the game, tactics etc.


        ** 5had0w5talk3r
           Man, fuck you. You don't know me or my positions. All I've
           ever wanted was for Valve to stop regressing tech used in
           their games in the name of "competitive balance". Before
           you know it the game is going to be nothing but a
           glorified 1.6. Bring proper physics simulation back to
           games!

           ** Leopard1907
              Positions?!
              That is just a fucking game , what kind of position a
              game can put you in?

              ** 5had0w5talk3r
                 Your position on aspects of the game (things you
                 like/dislike about and why). He's the one who
                 bundled me in with his strawman, anyway. I don't
                 understand why I'm getting shat on for saying I
                 don't like the direction GO took CS in. It's just an
                 opinion.

                 ** Leopard1907
                    Of course it is an opinion and i respect it.
                    However saying someone to fuck you because of a
                    game is absurd.

                    ** 5had0w5talk3r
                       His attitude was completely abrasive. I don't
                       like being shat on because I said I dislike
                       his favourite game.





           ** headless_cyborg
              proper physics simulation
              For trolls who want to cover the bomb with a barrel?

              ** 5had0w5talk3r
                 That was throwing the baby out with the bath water.
                 There's a million and one was to fix the problem:
                 make the bomb collideable with physics objects only,
                 improve placement of physics objects, make the bomb
                 LED glow through physics objects, etc. Instead Valve
                 took the easy shitty path that makes the game less
                 immersive.
                 Besides, realistically, what are the chances that
                 you can hide the bomb in a competitive match? You
                 have 1:55min to take a site and plant the bomb, with
                 40sec to try to hide the bomb while (likely) down on
                 men and defend the site against enemies who are
                 going to be rushing you very soon. It's just not a
                 realistic scenario.
                 Games in general barely have any physics simulation
                 at all compared to games from 10-15 years ago, which
                 is deeply saddening and really ruins the immersion
                 into the game world. A more accurate simulation of
                 the world makes the game more realistic, thus more
                 immersive, thus more fun.
