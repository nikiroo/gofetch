            <div class='comment_content'><p>It's been that way for a long time. People seem willing to give deep, nuanced opinions why the users of the world can't possibly use an office suite other than the one from Microsoft, but when you ask them to articulate a reproducible (therefore fixable) bug with any competitor, such as LibreOffice, it's nothing but crickets. Most of them never chose to switch from other apps to Microsoft's, so they don't really have reasons to give, you see. They're just uninterested in making problems for themselves for what they see as other people's crusade.</p><p>I suppose that psychologically speaking, it's the urge to defend one's behavior in the face of criticism. That's why criticizing Windows in general, and Windows users in particular , is not a very good method of persuasion.</p><p>The best persuasion isn't persuasion at all, and it's not a debate or provocation. It's gentle statement of fact: we use Linux to accomplish a, b, c, 1, 2, 3, successfully. No tool is best for all uses, but Linux is particularly good for x, y, z, 7, 8, 9.</p></div>

                <div class='comment_content'><p>I don't really use office apps any more either, but I'm relatively aware of issues involving app migration by users because I do a lot of scale migrations, since before Windows was even used in enterprise.</p><p>What's key is to identify how users are using the apps, and then which functionality. There are certain things that will never probably work perfectly in a competitor, but then for example [1]Excel macros don't necessarily even work in Microsoft's Mac version of Excel .</p><p>So on one hand, users in some industries and situations might have a lot of legacy macro-laden spreadsheets. But on the other hand, in a great many cases, workflows done in spreadsheets need to move to a more-structured system for risk reasons anyway (search on: "spreadsheet risk"). So we need to replace these [2]so-called "spreadmarts" with managed, audited, far less risky systems where it's hard for error to creep in due to human error and hard for unintentional forks of data and "code" to be made every time a spreadsheet is copied and e-mailed around.</p><p>Of course, replacing or implementing enterprise systems is complicated and takes time. More than a few firms are in the process of de-coupling themselves from proprietary apps from dBASE to Excel to Photoshop, with a goal of being dramatically more flexible in how their staff can work. Offsite from a cafe with a Chromebook? No problem. Update and approve data from iOS? No problem. Power users working miracles with Emacs on Linux? No problem.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>[1] http://blog.parallels.com/2016/01/21/differences-microsoft-office-mac/</p><p>[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadmart</p></div>

            <div class='comment_content'><p>Online is hard because it comes off as preachy. I just use the stuff in normal life and when someone wants to know how I do something, I show them. A number of people have switched to Libre Office and Linux because they see how I use it to do some very technical things easily, and it changes they preconceived notions about it. Sometimes I have had to work very hard to make things work, but I feel it is worth it in the long run. My biggest problem (and still occasionally is) is connecting to our MS Exchange mail/calendar server. The mail program Evolution does OK but my slightly outdated version still is missing some key calendar features. I need to check for updates on that. If people complain about Windows, I offer to set them up with a dual boot system so they can try Linux or go back to Windows if they need it for something special.</p></div>

Not everyone jumps on something the moment they find out about it. Was just a thought...

One of my favorite things about Linux is still customization as it lets you have fun in doing menial tasks.</p><p>Everyone in this community is awesome for the most part so as long as we still act as a positive influence and encourage others in the gaming community to make the switch in a welcoming manner then we should be able to come back here month after month and celebrate even more growth!</p></div>

      <div class='comment_content'><p>So do a lot of people, if those statistics are even remotely accurate. 30% of users still only have 2 physical cores, and 60% have 4. No hyperthreading stats in that section, but elsewhere it says only about half of surveyed systems have it. The number of users with 8-core chips is only slightly higher than the total Linux user stats. It's no wonder devs don't bother making their code use more threads, if only about 5% of Steam users have 6+ cores. Even scarier when you consider that, since it's restricted to Steam users, the survey probably over-represents higher-end systems.</p><p>RAM is more in line with what I expected, with the majority having 8 or 16GB. I did expect >16GB to be a bit higher than it was, though.</p><p>Also unsurprisingly, two 1920x1080 displays is the most common multi-monitor configuration. I'm disappointed that it doesn't give any sort of idea how many multi-monitor users there are in comparison to people still only using one.</p><p>Most of the stats are pretty consistent between Linux-only and Windows-only, too. Exceptions being higher representation of 16GB in Linux, and total disk space in Linux is much lower. The latter is probably because of people dual booting and allocating less space to Linux, since most of their space-eating games are in Windows.</p></div>

          <div class='comment_content'><p>That's true. It was already stupidly expensive when I built this PC last year, and it's only gotten worse since then apparently. I wish I could have maxed the board out then, but I was already pushing the budget when I went for 32GB. I was upgrading from a ridiculously outdated system that had 6GB, with an 8GB maximum (but one of the sticks died), so even the idea of using that much seemed insane at the time. I figured it would take years before I'd actually use 32... but then I got the PC built and immediately started using 50-90% of it regularly. Doesn't matter how much I have I'll find a way to use it, even if I have to install Steam games onto a ramdisk to do it.</p></div>

              <div class='comment_content'><p>See, I knew when I made it that I could find ways to utilise it if I tried . One of the first things I did with the newly built system was mount half of it as a ramdisk and compile something using all cores and no disk bottleneck, just to watch it fly, and after that I played a couple games off ramdisk to compare load times. I've been abusing Linux features in stupid ways for a long time, so I was looking forward to doing dumb stuff like that. Plus I knew I'd be doing GPU passthrough and using a large chunk of it for that VM.</p><p>The thing that surprised me is how quickly I went past 16 and even 24GB without intentionally doing things to use every scrap of memory available. Casual usage tends to sit at 10-14GB, and it goes up quickly from there when I start doing anything other than browsing.</p><p>It also didn't take long to adopt a "screw it, I don't need to close this program" mentality with programs I'm not using, only closing things when I get over ~80% usage or need more memory free to start the VM. I have a couple xkill -esque global shortcut that send SIGSTOP or SIGCONT to a window I click, so when I get done using a program for a while I tend to "pause" it instead of closing, so that I can leave even cpu-heavy programs open and avoid startup times.</p></div>

If so, it will take the general public a long time to accept it, just as it took them a long time to accept that semiconductor manufacturing made everything cheaper, better, faster, and use less powerful as time went on.</p><p>Nobody had any reason to think that the DRAM price increases that started slowly in 2016 would be the beginning of the end of hardware getting cheaper, but right now it's looking like that will have been the case.</p><p>The big opportunity going forward is from used hardware, as the prices are largely going to reflect the past when used hardware retained very little value after a couple of years. Linux users aren't chained to OEM operating system licenses and [1]activations when changing hardware . That gives Linux users a notable advantage because they can ignore activations and license concerns when shopping for used hardware and when incrementally upgrading their machine, unlike Windows users.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3bezYerYxQ</p></div>

    <div class='comment_content'><p>Those percents are misleading: they hide a big userbase that is greater than almost any game has. Yes, it's still a minority, but as with minorities that also has some beneficial implications. It's easier to get bigger traction. Also I wonder if there is a general genre bias in Linux userbase, but that probably cannot be researched as per-game Linux users stats are not published.</p></div>

Just because there's a small number (percentage) describing something that could also be described with a big number (count of users)? Or am I missing something?</p></div>

        <div class='comment_content'><p>How exactly do they "hide" the GNU/Linux userbase?</p><p>If they offer 15,000 titles, IDK how many they really do offer, and have 20 million subscribers with .78% using "GNU/Linux" you would think that GNU/Linux is a small segment maybe not worth developing software for. Yet if those .78% total userbase subscribers only play 10 titles, and of those 10 titles, 1 or 2 titles have 30% GNU/Linux userbase, than you have an obscured number. Especially if those 1 or 2 titles are in the top 10 most popular games on Steam.</p><p>Another way that .78% can be misleading is if the GNU/Linux crowd as a whole counts for a higher ratio of income than other players, and/or are as a whole spending more time per week than other groups. Let's say that the overwhelming majority of GNU/Linux users spend 22 hours a week using Steam where as only 5% of Windows users spend 20 hours or more playing Steam per week.</p><p></p><p>There are other metrics that can be easily exploited. My point is that maybe if it were reported in a more meaningful way, such as by reporting on how GNU/Linux gamers compare in metrics the Steam executives use to decide whether to continue supporting or even expanding services for the GNU/Linux market, we could all appreciate whether .78% is really a good thing, or a sign that we still on the fringe.</p></div>
