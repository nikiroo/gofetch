    I  ask  because the only way I know of to upgrade Mesa manually
    is  to  install  xorg-edgers,  and  the last time I did that it
    locked  me  out of doing a release upgrade. Nobody had any idea
    how   to  fix  it  short  of  a  complete  reinstall,  which  I
    reluctantly  did.  So ever since then I've been avoiding it. No
    mention  of  any  Mesa  upgrade is made on Kubuntu's changelog,
    and  Ubuntu's  team apparently [1]can't even be assed to post a
    changelog  at  all  .  And  I  figured probably some of you are
    already checking out the beta and would know.

     Last I'd heard Ubuntu 18.10 would be including Mesa 18.2 out of
     the box.
     For 18.04 the Padoka Stable PPA has had Mesa 18.2 since last
     week.

     It would appear that 18.2.1 is in 18.10.
