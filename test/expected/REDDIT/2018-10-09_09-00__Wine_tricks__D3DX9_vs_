    Hi!  I  have  league  of  legends  all set up on my desktop pc,
    running  arch with proprietary nvidia drivers, and all I had to
    run  the  game  is winetricks d3dx9. Now I try to install it on
    my  arch laptop as well, but this time the game crashes when it
    tries  to  run (the launcher works as intended tho). So I tried
    a  million  thing  to  eventually find that winetricks directx9
    works.  Now  the  game  runs surprisingly well for a 13" laptop
    with  only  intel integrated graphics. So my question is: whats
    the  difference  between  the  d3dx9 winetricks package and the
    directx9  one?  I  noticed d3dx9 never spawns any ui, while the
    directx9  package  prompts  an  old  looking install wizard. My
    theory  is  that  d3dx9 is just a part of the directx9 package,
    tho  I  am  quite  confused as to why my tower needs only d3dx9
    while the laptop needed another one. Thanks for any clue

     DirectX is a collection of API, the most common being Direct3D
     (for 3D graphics). D3DX is an extension (the "x" in the name)
     library for Direct3D.

     league of legends need wine staging..
     anti cheat stuff

        Both are using the exact same packages (pacman -S
        wine-staging && pacman -S $(pactree -l wine-staging))

     IIRC one of them installs a lot more ? I had a weird issue at
     one point where I needed to install d3dx9 to play the Monkey
     Island Special Editions.

     I'm not sure but look at the verbs in winetricks, there are
     comments about that:

     Try sticking to d3dx9_36 if you need it. Otherwise, WINE's
     builtin alternative should be fine. D3dx9 just extracks the
     components needed from the directx9 installer. Directx9 installs
     the whole thing, even the parts that tend to conflict with WINE.
     The game on the intel laptop was probably trying to run a bit of
     different code for the intel chipset, something that wasn't
     properly handled by WINE's alternative.
