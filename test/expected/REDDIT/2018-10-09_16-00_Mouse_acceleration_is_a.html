		All Linux distributions I have used required me to tweak the mouse settings before it was usable for gaming.<br/><br/>Stock Ubuntu for example comes with mouse acceleration enabled by default and there is no option to turn it off. WTF?<br/><br/>Even on touchpads mouse acceleration feels like its doing more harm than good and I dont like it :(<br/><br/>edit: Instead of giving me gold please donate the money to a charity or GNU developers.

      <div class='comment_content'><p>There even was a time when libinput didn't support flat acceleration at all while some distros (namely arch) had already moved to it. I downgraded that package immediately. If I remember correctly the devs were quite dismissive of this and didn't think it was a high priority, because who doesn't want mouse acceleration? And isn't setting it to some really low value just like turning it off?</p><p>No, it's not and yes I notice it immediately. I refuse to buy many mice because they can't track without some leftover acceleration ffs. With Linux being more and more viable as a gaming platform this just can't be ignored. I know people who tried switching to Linux because they heard CSGO, the only game they ever play, runs. They were just as stupefied as you'd expect them to be that there was no option for disabling mouse acceleration completely and that they had to manually edit config files. "Yeah, Linux is really easy these days, uhh, except for that I guess"</p></div>

There is an option in mouse settings for "custom acceleration" where you can turn it back on, though, if you want it. But seriously, most everyone seems to prefer it off, hence why they changed that. It's stupid to have accel be the default, and even if you make it the default, at least provide a way to easily disable it.</p><p>All distros should do the same.

From what I can tell, there's also no real option for changing your desktop sensitivity once you're rid of mouse acceleration if you don't have working DPI settings. Changing the transform matrix through xinput seems like the best solution, but causes the camera to spin uncontrollably in a ton of games for some reason.</p><p></p><p>I suppose you could make a script to disable/enable it as needed, but most games have menus and overlays that you need to interact with regularly so that would be a lot of hotkey presses over time.</p></div>
