    The   fact   that   there   are  two  drivers  is  the  biggest
    headscratcher  from  AMD really since they started really doing
    a  good  job.  I  can't  see  why they are fragmenting that one
    specific thing rather than just slowly merging it into RADV.

        Because radv isn't their driver and amdvlk shares its code
        with the windows driver.
        But it's not that bad, as the biggest performance gains will
        likely come from optimizing llvm, which both drivers make use
        of*.
        Also it's not a problem to install two Vulkan drivers side by
        side so users could always do that if they really need both.
        * except for the pro stack, which uses a proprietary compiler
        shared with windows. I think their plan was to improve llvm
        and replace the proprietary compiler when llvm caught up in
        performance, but don't quote me on that
