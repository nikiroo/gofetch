    Is  anyone  else  having  trouble  getting  lutris to launch in
    ubuntu after its latest update (earlier this week)?
    
    Attempts  to  launch it in the terminal give me a cryptic error
    (to me, very much a non developer) about a problem on line 25.
    
    A  stab  in  the  dark,  but  I'm  thinking I either wait until
    someone  else  sees  the  problem and fixes it or try to find a
    way  to  install  an  earlier version. Any other suggestions? I
    don't  want  to  have to break down and *clutches pearles* boot
    Windows to play my game.

     What if you download the tarball and try running lutris from the
     extracted folder?

        Joy! I wound up going to openSUSE's build service and
        downloading the .deb for lutris for my version of ubuntu.
        It's a slightly older version, but it runs my game now. I'm
        thinking the repo got borked up somehow and when I did my
        update that screwed something up.

     Would you be able to share the error message here?

        Traceback (most recent call last):

           [1]I found this thread that mentions upgrading from Python
           3.6 to Python 3.7 potentially breaking Lutris, as it
           installs some things into the versioned python directory
           in /usr/lib, which would likely be the "missing" modules.
           I know you've already fixed the situation on your machine,
           but I figured maybe the information would be useful if
           someone else runs into the same error.
