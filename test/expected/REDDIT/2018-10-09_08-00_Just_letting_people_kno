    I  have  no  affiliation  to the devs or anything, just a linux
    lowend  laptop  gamer. I highly recommend this game! Obligatory

     It is an excellent game. Picked up form GOG awhile back. Have
     yet to end it, though.

     For those who are curious you're inside a dungeon and you play
     as a mage and you have to kill mobs and survive to like stage 5
     to kill the final boss, each stages has a mini boss. As you play
     you gain XP to unlock cards and characters and also completing
     little challenges to earn something. It's a short game and a bit
     repetitive but it is a very fun little game for that price.
     You're welcome.

        Each level also has one secret room behind a cracked wall.

        ** RootFury
           Yup forgot that one.

           Oooh i did not know that!


        ** Sydeh
           oh! I've been playing this game a bit this last fortnight
           and no idea!

        It also runs well on weak hardware. No issue running it on a
        4th gen i3 laptop part with integrated graphics.

        ** RootFury
           It was a rushed review lol.



  ** yusdacra
     This is one of the best games for linux native and it runs
     perfect even in low end.

  ** PCgamingFreedom
     This game runs fine on Mesa.

     Got it on a Humble Bundle once before and I've never played it.
     Perhaps I should.

     ** LionelSlothrop
        You really should! Its pretty small too which is nice and
        doesnt kill your hard drive storage
