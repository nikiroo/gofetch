		In case you haven&#x27;t already heard about it, if you have a GOG account you can get Shadow Warrior 2 for free [1]here<br/><br/>Shadow Warrior 2 sadly didn&#x27;t get a native Linux release like the first reboot but using a combination of Wine and DXVK you can get it running fairly smoothly (on semi outdated hardware)<br/><br/>How to get it running<br/><br/>The game got an [2]install script for Lutris a few hours ago that runs by installing with the offline setup from GOG.<br/><br/>Another option is to install and run [3]GOG Galaxy which you can use to download and update the game and also to synchronize your savegames.<br/><br/>[4]Here is a video demonstration of it running on my cpu bottlenecked hardware (i5 2500 + 1060 3GB), so with any newer or overclocked CPU you should be good to go.<br/><br/>Quick Troubleshooting (any other fixes are welcome)<br/><br/>Game running really really slow ingame:<br/><br/>Right click the game/GOG Galaxy in Lutris, select wine configuration and in the new window set the windows version to windows 10<br/><br/>If it&#x27;s still slow, right click it in Lutris, select configure and go to system settings. Enable &#x27;run in terminal&#x27;<br/><br/>Invisible Floors:<br/><br/>Right click the game in Lutris and make sure you have DXVK enabled as invisible floors usually occur in wined3d11<br/><br/>Another way to check if DXVK is running and working is to set the environment variable DXVK_HUD to &#x27;fps&#x27;<br/><br/><br/><br/>[1] https://www.gog.com/game/shadow_warrior_2<br/><br/>[2] https://lutris.net/games/shadow-warrior-2/<br/><br/>[3] https://lutris.net/games/gog-galaxy/<br/><br/>[4] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsdGb0DFdW0

    <div class='comment_content'><p>Prior to the release of Shadow Warrior 2, I had purchased both Shadow Warrior "Classic" and Shadow Warrio, thinking I might play them back-to-back once I had all three.</p><p>But after the devs/publisher reneged on a promised Linux release, I swore I would never buy this game. And now I don't have to. I can enjoy their game and they get NADA from me.</p><p>Fuck them. Thank you GoG.</p></div>
