    I  recently  bought Northgard, because the store page says that
    it  supports Linux, I downloaded it, tried to launch it, and it
    didn't  work.  Does anyone know what needs to be done to get it
    to work?
    
    I  tried running the run.sh file from the CLI, but that did not
    work.  The  output it gives me is ./run.sh: line 1: ./linux/hl:
    No such file or directory
    
    ./run.sh: line 2: ./linux/hl: No such file or directory
    
    So,  I'm  not  sure  what to do at this point, I'd like to keep
    it,  as  I got it on sale, but if it doesn't work, I guess I'll
    have to refund it.
    
    EDIT:  There  was a patch, it seems to be good now. I didn't do
    anything to fix it.

     It was fixed in another patch.

        Good to know!

     I can only suggest the classic things to try, but maybe they'll
     help:
     
     Try validating game files
     
     Try running steam in a terminal and see what gets printed out
     when you try running the game. Maybe it'll give you a hint.
     
     Try rebooting, especially if you haven't rebooted since you did
     a system update.
     Maybe also check the game's Steam discussion forums, chances are
     someone else is having the same issue.

     ** T0RB1T
        I've already done all the other things. Just checked the
        community page... A LOT of people are having the same issue.
        So, I guess it'll probably get fixed.

     Wait, I followed this game for awhile before removing that from
     my wishlist. That was long time back in windows-time. I didn't
     know it's available in Linux. Thanks for the nudge.

     ** T0RB1T
        Heh, no problem! Hopefully this issue gets fixed soon.

     Does this file presents there? If yes, make it executable.

     ** T0RB1T
        I'm not sure I totally understand your suggestion.

        ** Shished
           Open game folder and check if linux/hl file exists. If it
           exists, make it executable (right click, properties,
           permissions)

           ** T0RB1T
              AH! Thanks! I'll definitely try that when I get a
              chance.
              Edit: They do exist, and they are executable.

     If you paid for it then you're entitled to tech support. Contact
     the creator?
     I can tell you that it works great for me in Ubuntu 18.04 with
     Padoka PPA. You didn't describe your setup so it's hard to help
     you.

     ** T0RB1T
        That's fair. My drivers are all up to date, just about every
        other game works, and I'm on kubuntu 18.10

        ** Nurgus
           Kubuntu 18.10 isn't released yet so still a beta. Are you
           using nvidia or amd hardware?
           I can tell you that Northard works great in Ubuntu 18.04
           and Mesa 18.1.
           Are you able to try it in anything resembling that?
           I do urge you to contact the official tech support.
           They'll know better than anyone what logs the game can
           kick out.

           ** T0RB1T
              Yeah, I'll talk to them later today. I'm currently at
              work.
              And I'm. On nvidia, most recent drivers, and I actually
              did try it on 18.04 before. Not joy then either.

              ** Nurgus
                 Ok. I can't advise you on Nvidia related stuff. Good
                 luck. It's a nice game. :)

                 ** T0RB1T
                    Yeah, I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually.

     You should try it from the Northgard folder instead from the
     linux folder and run it with './linux/run.sh'.

     ** T0RB1T
        I think I tried that.


  ** headless_cyborg
     Works great for me on Arch Linux. What's your distribution,
     drivers, hardware?

     ** T0RB1T
        Kubuntu, Nvidia gtx 1070, drivers are 396.54, intel 4790k.
