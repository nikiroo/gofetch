    I  am  struggling  to  find 1:1 parity with mouse input between
    Linux  and  Windows  for  games  run via Proton/Wine. For games
    with native builds, I am able to achieve perfect 1:1 mapping.
    
    Native example:
    
    ezquake 3.5
    
    sensitivity 2.2 @ 800 dpi == ~23.7cm/360
    
    ezquake  uses  "Raw  Input"  in  Windows  and  "EVDEV mouse" in
    Linux. My sensitivity is exactly the same in both OS.
    
    I  was  able to replicate this exact sensitivity in CS:GO, same
    settings
    
    Wine example (via Steam Play (Proton 3.7-7))
    
    quakelive
    
    sensitivity 2.2 @ 800 dpi == way larger than my mousepad
    
    I   found   that  I  could  get  close  to  23.7cm/360  with  a
    sensitivity 5
    
    in_mouse 2  in_MouseMode win32(raw)
    
    My  hunch is that by default, Wine is not reading the raw input
    and  is  instead  using  X11 mouse in some way and then telling
    the  windows  game  that it is raw (when it is in fact not). Is
    this a setting that can be changed?
    
    Also  worth  nothing  -  I  have disabled acceleration via xorg
    config: Section "InputClass"
    
    Identifier "My Mouse"
    
    MatchIsPointer "yes"
    
    Option "AccelerationProfile" "-1"
    
    Option "AccelerationScheme" "none"
    
    Option "AccelSpeed" "-1"
    
    EndSection

     I play Quake Live in WINE and I'm having no issues with this
     profile (1:1 parity with windows):
     /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mouse-acceleration.conf
     
     Section "InputClass"
     Identifier "My Mouse"
     Driver "libinput"
     MatchIsPointer "yes"
     Option "AccelProfile" "flat"
     EndSection
     
     My hunch is that by default, Wine is not reading the raw input
     and is instead using X11 mouse in some way and then telling the
     windows game that it is raw (when it is in fact not). Is this a
     setting that can be changed?
     Why would this matter? Doesn't your profile disable mouse
     acceleration (and presumably use 1:1 input)?

        I don't think X11 pointer movement is identical to raw input
        even without acceleration. [1]libinput tries to do
        normalization for high dpi mice down to 1000 dpi. I'm not
        sure if "one mickey = one pixel" is even true for 1000 dpi
        mice either.
        EDIT: The desktop environment might also override Xorg's
        libinput settings at runtime. For Plasma desktop, I had to
        enable the "flat" profile in the mouse settings gui because
        my xorg.conf.d file stopped working after some update. Of
        note here is that that mouse gui doesn't have a perfect
        middle setting for the sensitivity slider (called
        acceleration here), so I had to set
        XLbInptPointerAcceleration=0 in "~/.config/kcminputrc". The
        one left of the middle would result in a value of -0.11 and
        the one right of the middle is 0.11.

        I don't suspect it does matter - but I thought sharing it
        would cut off the default recommendation to disable
        acceleration.
        This is why I am getting 1:1 for native apps - issue is that
        Wine seems to do something else with mouse input, and I
        cannot find any details on configuration options on that
        front.

        ** PolygonKiwii
           Native apps that have raw input (CS:GO) will have 1:1
           tracking even if you leave non-linear pointer acceleration
           on.

           ** some_random_guy_5345
              This is what I suspect is happening. The profile in the
              OP probably isn't 1:1 tracking.
              Native games use raw input whereas WINE probably
              doesn't support it.

              ** PolygonKiwii
                 I wonder why Wine doesn't support it.

        Just switched to your conf, and I now have perfect 1:1
        mapping in QL
        Thank you!
