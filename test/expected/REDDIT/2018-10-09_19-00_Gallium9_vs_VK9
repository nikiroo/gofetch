    So  i  read  an interview that the DXVK dev was inspired by VK9
    so i decided to check it out, and then remembered Gallium9.
    
    I  understand  VK9  tries  to translate the calls to Vulkan but
    what does Gallium9 do different from VK9?

     One important difference not mentioned yet: Gallium is working.
     VK9 is still in development. Another is that gallium is for open
     source drivera only. vK9 a more generic translation layer
     similar to dxvk. Zink is a new project to do gallium over
     vulkan, would give similar solution as VK9. But even earlier in
     dev you could say.

        Another is that gallium is for open source drivera only
        Not even, only gallium drivers, so not the current Intel one
        because it's a classic Mesa one.


  ** breell
     Gallium nine is a Gallium state tracker that takes D3D9 in.

  ** ComputerMystic
     Gallium Nine, from what I understand, cuts out the middleman.
     It's implementing DX9 in the driver the same way GL or Vulkan
     would be, without translating the DX9 calls to another
     intermediate API before letting the driver do its thing with
     them.

     ** breell
        Well technically it does translate D3D9 to another
        intermediate API: the Gallium API, but so does the OGL state
        tracker.


  ** rea987
     Gallium Nine provides native Direct3D 9 rendering, VK9
     translates Direct3D 9 calls into Vulkan.

     iirc gallium would be better since its a linux native dx9
     implementation if i understand. but nvidia wont use it :(
