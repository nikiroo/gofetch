                    By setting their Windows computers on fire? Nah,
                    besides that happens already. Instead we show
                    them Linux can save their computers, and their
                    privacy, and their sanity, and give them better
                    performance, all at once!

                       No we set the peasants on fire. Like so:

        I don't think it's sad. There are a lot of different distros
        for any kind of people. Which is a good thing in my opinion
        (as long as they are maintained obviously).

        I did that for my niece and nephew. It worked great until
        Fortnite. Goddamn Epic and their goddamn assumptions.

        ** pdp10
           Epic has deals with Microsoft, and is partially owned by
           PRC interests.
           Now, I'm not saying that causes them not to be on Linux;
           they're currently on non-Microsoft platforms from Apple,
           Sony, and Nintendo. I am saying that their deals with
           Microsoft could be correlated in some way with their
           platform decisions, however. Valve has no deals with
           Microsoft as far as I know, which could be correlated with
           their support of Linux/SteamOS.

              Installing Linux is sort of the equivalent of moving to
              Canada when one doesn’t like US political trends.
              Nope, we’ve got to fight for the freedoms we have
              today, where we have them today.

              I'm just frustrated that Epic made their game engine
              (Unreal 4) support Linux, and then decided their
              flagship game shouldn't demonstrate that capability,
              because that's somehow a bad investment.
              One would hope that Publishers would at some point stop
              seeing Linux users as the market potential, when, in
              fact, it's the Windows Users that are the untapped part
              of the market. Any old indie company can't do that, but
              major AAA game publishers could, if they wanted to.

              I brought up Linux on a thread in [1]/r/pcgaming where
              people were bitching about how shitty windows 10 is and
              I was instantly downvoted.
              It's like these people are standing in a pool of shit
              and complaining about how much it stinks but if you
              tell them they don't have to stand in a pool of shit
              they tell you to fuck off.

                 It's been that way for a long time. People seem
                 willing to give deep, nuanced opinions why the users
                 of the world can't possibly use an office suite
                 other than the one from Microsoft, but when you ask
                 them to articulate a reproducible (therefore
                 fixable) bug with any competitor, such as
                 LibreOffice, it's nothing but crickets. Most of them
                 never chose to switch from other apps to
                 Microsoft's, so they don't really have reasons to
                 give, you see. They're just uninterested in making
                 problems for themselves for what they see as other
                 people's crusade.
                 I suppose that psychologically speaking, it's the
                 urge to defend one's behavior in the face of
                 criticism. That's why criticizing Windows in
                 general, and Windows users in particular , is not a
                 very good method of persuasion.
                 The best persuasion isn't persuasion at all, and
                 it's not a debate or provocation. It's gentle
                 statement of fact: we use Linux to accomplish a, b,
                 c, 1, 2, 3, successfully. No tool is best for all
                 uses, but Linux is particularly good for x, y, z, 7,
                 8, 9.

                    We're migrating back to Windows where I work.
                    Users were complaining about missing features and
                    compatibility issues in Libre Office
                    sheets/excel. Unfortunately Microsoft Office is
                    very good and it's hard to find any replacement
                    that matches the overall experience.
                    I rarely use any office suite applications at all
                    so can't really point at specific things myself.

                    ** pdp10
                       I don't really use office apps any more
                       either, but I'm relatively aware of issues
                       involving app migration by users because I do
                       a lot of scale migrations, since before
                       Windows was even used in enterprise.
                       What's key is to identify how users are using
                       the apps, and then which functionality. There
                       are certain things that will never probably
                       work perfectly in a competitor, but then for
                       example [1]Excel macros don't necessarily even
                       work in Microsoft's Mac version of Excel .
                       So on one hand, users in some industries and
                       situations might have a lot of legacy
                       macro-laden spreadsheets. But on the other
                       hand, in a great many cases, workflows done in
                       spreadsheets need to move to a more-structured
                       system for risk reasons anyway (search on:
                       "spreadsheet risk"). So we need to replace
                       these [2]so-called "spreadmarts" with managed,
                       audited, far less risky systems where it's
                       hard for error to creep in due to human error
                       and hard for unintentional forks of data and
                       "code" to be made every time a spreadsheet is
                       copied and e-mailed around.
                       Of course, replacing or implementing
                       enterprise systems is complicated and takes
                       time. More than a few firms are in the process
                       of de-coupling themselves from proprietary
                       apps from dBASE to Excel to Photoshop, with a
                       goal of being dramatically more flexible in
                       how their staff can work. Offsite from a cafe
                       with a Chromebook? No problem. Update and
                       approve data from iOS? No problem. Power users
                       working miracles with Emacs on Linux? No
                       problem.

                    The bad thing is that open source software is
                    pretty much inoperable more or less with
                    proprietary formats. And open formats don't work
                    that well inside proprietary suites.
                    You may have ODF but people use OOXML.
                    You may have .xcf but people use .psd
                    I only yesterday had to edit a poster that had
                    some text in it and found that GIMP cannot edit
                    text inside a .psd file (it renders it as raster
                    image). There was no plug-in for this and found
                    no converter from psd to xcf. So I had to rely on
                    a site that can see the font in pictures and go
                    to trial and error to make the text similar. Not
                    quite the best alternative to running Photoshop.

                 Most PC users don't really want the usability of a

                 Online is hard because it comes off as preachy. I
                 just use the stuff in normal life and when someone
                 wants to know how I do something, I show them. A
                 number of people have switched to Libre Office and
                 Linux because they see how I use it to do some very
                 technical things easily, and it changes they
                 preconceived notions about it. Sometimes I have had
                 to work very hard to make things work, but I feel it
                 is worth it in the long run. My biggest problem (and
                 still occasionally is) is connecting to our MS
                 Exchange mail/calendar server. The mail program
                 Evolution does OK but my slightly outdated version
                 still is missing some key calendar features. I need
                 to check for updates on that. If people complain
                 about Windows, I offer to set them up with a dual
                 boot system so they can try Linux or go back to
                 Windows if they need it for something special.

           figured out how to run that in linux. They want to play
           Roblox and use my phone for it for now. I tell them about
           how I disapprove of Microsoft and how by using
           alternatives, they make computing better for the world.
           Then I get them a new Linux game and keep them happy for a

        Well, if you put it in perspective, since Proton was
        announced, our total user base has increased by 59% .
        And that is just in less than two months, not even a month
        and a half. That is insane growth. [1]It's so insane that we
        actually reversed over a year's worth of decline in less than
        two months .

           I think not everyone boots up Steam every day, especially
           if they're a Linux gamer that was only playing the SteamOS
           compatible games until now, and maybe doesn't follow the
           news as much. There's also a whole bunch of Linux players
           running the Windows Steam client in wine, which means when
           that survey (that popped up this week) reports back, it'll
           report Windows.
           
           In short, I think there's a whole bunch of Linux gamers
           that haven't come on board yet.

              How did nearly an extra 60% of users all decided to
              just start running Steam again in the last month and a
              half, completely unrelated to the announcement of
              Proton?
              And even then, what about the substantial loss of
              percentage over the last couple of years? Surely we
              wouldn't have seen our numbers steadily drop lower and
              lower too we were nearly reduced by half if these
              people were still there.
              
              There's also a whole bunch of Linux players running the
              Windows Steam client in wine, which means when that
              survey (that popped up this week) reports back, it'll
              report Windows.
              In the past the hardware survey explicitly detected
              that steam is running in wine and even what version,
              all to be counted as Linux or Other (iirc). I see no
              reason that'd change now or any time in the last year+.
              E: rereading this I may come across as rather angry.
              Not my intent, I'm just tired. Sorry

                 unrelated to the announcement of Proton?
                 I'm not saying "nobody" did it, I'm saying there
                 might be a significant portion that didn't see the
                 article. Maybe not as significant as I initially
                 thought, but I'm sure more users will trickle in
                 over time. Or users that saw the news but didn't
                 think it's a priority for their gaming habits,
                 installing Steam Linux when their wine version was
                 working fine. Not everyone jumps on something the
                 moment they find out about it. Was just a thought...
                 I happened to install Linux on my old netbook
                 literally days before the news dropped, so I was
                 still in the "what can I do with my new favourite
                 OS" phase, but not everyone is like this. They're
                 just happy if it works.
                 
                 In the past the hardware survey explicitly detected
                 that steam is running in wine and even what version,
                 all to be counted as Linux or Other (iirc)
                 Oh I didn't know this.

                 Surely we wouldn't have seen our numbers steadily
                 drop lower and lower too we were nearly reduced by
                 half if these people were still there.
                 Percentage-wise, you could have. Assuming more new
                 windows/macOS users come, while most linux users
                 that were using steam are already on it.



           ** graemeLinux
              The survey isn't what counts the OS. The OS is
              auto-reported on sign on. The survey reports things
              that the sign-on doesn't know or don't want to figure
              out, like speed tests, etc. They know exactly how many
              people are online with linux, mac, windows, etc at any
              point in time.



        ** mishugashu
           I don't think we actually declined, we just grew slower
           than Windows. Looking at market share to see growth on a
           single platform isn't really correct. What if a bunch of
           Mac users suddenly stop gaming on Steam? Linux will go
           up... but did we grow?



     ** SteveHeist
        Considering that pushes our number from about an additional
        1/3 over last month to close to 2/5, it's nice to see at
        least.

        ** HER0_01
           Except that this error was present before this fix, which
           means it likely effected every stat they released from the
           start of Steam on Linux. If they updated past stats after
           applying this and you recalculated it, the growth would
           certainly be lower.

           ** eggman_jr
              They do this every month.

              ** HER0_01
                 Yes, they publish stats every month, and all of
                 those likely are effected by that error except for
                 the updated September ones. The old data is not
                 correct.

                 ** eggman_jr
                    What I mean is they update their stats every
                    month, about a week after publication.

                    ** HER0_01
                       Yes, I know, which is why I said "they publish
                       stats every month."
                       The problem is all of those stats except for
                       September, which they corrected are likely
                       affected by this error. This throws off our
                       calculations of growth, because groups that
                       were not represented before are now
                       represented, creating an artificial boost in
                       apparent growth.

     I helped a teeny bit by getting 2 people to switch to Linux
     recently. But mostly thanks to all the people working on all the
     software that makes up the systems we use!
     I'll just keep trying to convert more people! Hopefully once we
     break 1% we can take over the world, mwahahaha >:)

  ** LucasZanella
     Wait. There was an error... and it went up ?

        Another way to look at it - there was an error... and windows
        went down.


  ** Breadland
     If they add all the fixes that were found for a lot of the
     non-whitelisted games, I think a lot more people would use it.
     Fallout 4 didn't work for me at first. But after looking at
     spcr.netlify.com and the github issues page for proton, I found
     the 3 things I had to do to fix all my problems. Now it runs
     flawlessly. Well it hangs on exit, but apart from that, I never
     had any issues ingame.
     If Valve would add a way to implement these community fixes, so
     the average user doesn't have to do anything in the terminal or
     in the fallout .ini files, then playing Windows only games on
     Linux would be a lot more accessible.
     So hopefully by the time Proton comes out of beta, we'll have
     this feature implemented.

     ** FurbyOnSteroid
        I'm almost certain that this is where it's heading. As soon
        as they know how a certain game can be played, all they need
        to do is to put these instructions into the "first-time-run"
        setup present on any game which sets these things
        automatically.

        ** PolygonKiwii
           Ironically, the "first-time-run" setup on some games is
           the only thing blocking them from working perfectly out of
           the box. Having Proton-specific ones would be a great
           step. They could start by removing runtimes that are built
           into Wine already and won't install cleanly anyway.



  ** jaykstah
     I'm very excited to see this momentum. I switched to Linux Mint
     and quickly fell back into Win10 due to friends still regularly
     playing PUBG and some other games that are broken on Linux. This
     past month I've switched back to 100% Linux usage going from
     Kubuntu to Ubuntu back to Mint on my main machine (have also
     been only using Linux Mint or Ubuntu on my laptop for the past
     year and a half or so).
     I'm glad I hopped back in to contribute to this growth. Moving
     into 2019 let's make some big moves and make sure everyone knows
     that Linux is the place to be if you want to play games and
     simply have fun with your computer! One of my favorite things
     about Linux is still customization as it lets you have fun in
     doing menial tasks.
     Everyone in this community is awesome for the most part so as
     long as we still act as a positive influence and encourage
     others in the gaming community to make the switch in a welcoming
     manner then we should be able to come back here month after
     month and celebrate even more growth!

     ** INITMalcanis
        I'm very excited to see this momentum.
        
        It is exciting! And I'm delighted to find that Linux is
        become so new-user friendly just when MS appears to be
        dialing all the things that people dislike about Windows up
        to 11.
        It's long been an aphorism of mine that the future happens
        either half as fast or 10 times quicker than anyone expects.
        Linux has had a long run of "half as fast" - I find myself
        hoping that there's going to be a phase change to "10 times
        as quick".

     ** ws-ilazki
        So do a lot of people, if those statistics are even remotely
        accurate. 30% of users still only have 2 physical cores, and
        60% have 4. No hyperthreading stats in that section, but
        elsewhere it says only about half of surveyed systems have
        it. The number of users with 8-core chips is only slightly
        higher than the total Linux user stats. It's no wonder devs
        don't bother making their code use more threads, if only
        about 5% of Steam users have 6+ cores. Even scarier when you
        consider that, since it's restricted to Steam users, the
        survey probably over-represents higher-end systems.
        RAM is more in line with what I expected, with the majority
        having 8 or 16GB. I did expect >16GB to be a bit higher than
        it was, though.
        Also unsurprisingly, two 1920x1080 displays is the most
        common multi-monitor configuration. I'm disappointed that it
        doesn't give any sort of idea how many multi-monitor users
        there are in comparison to people still only using one.
        Most of the stats are pretty consistent between Linux-only
        and Windows-only, too. Exceptions being higher representation
        of 16GB in Linux, and total disk space in Linux is much
        lower. The latter is probably because of people dual booting
        and allocating less space to Linux, since most of their
        space-eating games are in Windows.

           games are in Windows.
           It's also because it's not detecting it correctly. For me
           it always lists the amount of free space on my root
           filesystem as the "total" disk space, no matter how many
           other drives are mounted.


        ** INITMalcanis
           RAM is God damb expensive these days, that's maybe why

           ** ws-ilazki
              That's true. It was already stupidly expensive when I
              built this PC last year, and it's only gotten worse
              since then apparently. I wish I could have maxed the
              board out then, but I was already pushing the budget
              when I went for 32GB. I was upgrading from a
              ridiculously outdated system that had 6GB, with an 8GB
              maximum (but one of the sticks died), so even the idea
              of using that much seemed insane at the time. I figured
              it would take years before I'd actually use 32... but
              then I got the PC built and immediately started using
              50-90% of it regularly. Doesn't matter how much I have
              I'll find a way to use it, even if I have to install
              Steam games onto a ramdisk to do it.

                 immediately started using 50-90% of it regularly.
                 That's always how it works, especially in modern
                 systems with virtual memory.
                 Back when we had RISC workstations that had 8 to 32
                 times as much memory as a contemporary gaming PC,
                 those with the latter just couldn't see how the
                 memory would ever get used.

                 ** ws-ilazki
                    See, I knew when I made it that I could find ways
                    to utilise it if I tried . One of the first
                    things I did with the newly built system was
                    mount half of it as a ramdisk and compile
                    something using all cores and no disk bottleneck,
                    just to watch it fly, and after that I played a
                    couple games off ramdisk to compare load times.
                    I've been abusing Linux features in stupid ways
                    for a long time, so I was looking forward to
                    doing dumb stuff like that. Plus I knew I'd be
                    doing GPU passthrough and using a large chunk of
                    it for that VM.
                    The thing that surprised me is how quickly I went
                    past 16 and even 24GB without intentionally doing
                    things to use every scrap of memory available.
                    Casual usage tends to sit at 10-14GB, and it goes
                    up quickly from there when I start doing anything
                    other than browsing.
                    It also didn't take long to adopt a "screw it, I
                    don't need to close this program" mentality with
                    programs I'm not using, only closing things when
                    I get over ~80% usage or need more memory free to
                    start the VM. I have a couple xkill -esque global
                    shortcut that send SIGSTOP or SIGCONT to a window
                    I click, so when I get done using a program for a
                    while I tend to "pause" it instead of closing, so
                    that I can leave even cpu-heavy programs open and
                    avoid startup times.

                          Actually, I forgot that I recently merged
                          them into a single shortcut/script, so that
                          was slightly incorrect. I originally
                          started with a couple shell functions, stop
                          and cont , that would do kill -STOP (or
                          -CONT) if given a PID or assume a process
                          name and use killall otherwise. Then I
                          reproduced that as-is with two shortcuts
                          and xdotool and did that for a bit.
                          Finally, the current setup, which checks if
                          the selected window is paused with ps and
                          sends the appropriate signal to toggle
                          state.
                          Here's the current script: #!/bin/sh
                          
                          # Get a pid via cursor, similar to xkill,
                          and STOP it.
                          # If pid is already stopped (state T), CONT
                          instead.
                          
                          pid="$(xdotool selectwindow getwindowpid)"
                          state="$(ps -q $pid -o state --no-headers)"
                          signal="-STOP"
                          
                          if [ "x$state" = "xT" ] ; then
                          signal="-CONT"
                          fi
                          
                          kill $signal $pid
                          Right now I have it bound to meta+s as a
                          mnemonic for "stop" but meta+p for
                          "play|pause" would probably make more
                          sense.

           It's no wonder devs don't bother making their code use
           more threads, if only about 5% of Steam users have 6+
           cores.
           One generally-accepted theory is that both major consoles
           being 8-core AMD APUs since 2013 has already been pushing
           developers of performance-intensive titles to use ~7 cores
           effectively in their cross-platform games.
           
           Also unsurprisingly, two 1920x1080 displays is the most
           common multi-monitor configuration.
           Multiple 1920x1080 has been the most cost-effective,
           high-value configuration for a number of years, and I
           assume that's why the popularity.
           The Hardware Survey says that Linux users are
           significantly more likely to be using both UHD/4K
           3840x2160 and also laptop-res 1366x768, interestingly
           enough. Basically, there's more hardware diversity at the
           low and high end with Linux, which suggests that Linux is
           less likely to be used to game on dedicated gaming rigs,
           and more likely to be used to game where it's already
           installed on high-end workstations and on regular laptops.

              One generally-accepted theory is that both major
              consoles being 8-core AMD APUs since 2013 has already
              been pushing developers of performance-intensive titles
              to use ~7 cores effectively in their cross-platform
              games.
              I noticed that myself. And now that Ryzen finally
              dragged Intel kicking and screaming into the >4 core
              world, hopefully it will continue to improve.
              
              Multiple 1920x1080 has been the most cost-effective,
              high-value configuration for a number of years, and I
              assume that's why the popularity
              Probably, it's what I favour for the same reason,
              though I use more than two displays because there's
              never enough screen real estate. I sort of hoped to see
              a larger portion of users with resolutions indicating
              more than two displays when I saw the gtx 1060 (which
              has at least 4 outputs) was the most popular GPU.
              I really wish the survey gave some indication of the
              ratio of multi-display vs. single-display users, like I
              already said. I've noticed it's a lot more common than
              it was when I first started doing it, but I'm curious
              to know how common it's gotten. People tend to scoff at
              the idea until they try it and then they never go back.

           Also money

           The num of cores thing is also kind of a chicken and egg
           situation. I have a pretty decent PC with “only” 4 cores
           i5-6600 because for games and most workloads it’s more
           than enough while the saved money could be spent by me on
           faster RAM and stronger GPU.
           My gf’s PC has 6 cores not because having 6+ cores made
           great sense at the time of buying it (nor atm IMO) but
           only because the new Coffee Lake i5 CPUs increased the
           cores number and her PC is about a year newer than mine.
           It just makes sense, if games are the main intended
           workload, to buy a better GPU even at a cost of a weaker
           CPU, so I’d expect much lower number of high-end CPUs than
           GPUs in the Steam survey.

        Hardware pricing and availability has been a roller-coaster
        for the last couple of years.
        It's entirely possible that we've seen the turning point
        where hardware stops getting cheaper and faster as time goes
        on. If so, it will take the general public a long time to
        accept it, just as it took them a long time to accept that
        semiconductor manufacturing made everything cheaper, better,
        faster, and use less powerful as time went on.
        Nobody had any reason to think that the DRAM price increases
        that started slowly in 2016 would be the beginning of the end
        of hardware getting cheaper, but right now it's looking like
        that will have been the case.
        The big opportunity going forward is from used hardware, as
        the prices are largely going to reflect the past when used
        hardware retained very little value after a couple of years.
        Linux users aren't chained to OEM operating system licenses
        and [1]activations when changing hardware . That gives Linux
        users a notable advantage because they can ignore activations
        and license concerns when shopping for used hardware and when
        incrementally upgrading their machine, unlike Windows users.

     I moved to Linux full time about a month or so ago, been trying
     to launch new steam games to just see if they work and edge up
     the stats (as I have no time to play them any more).
     Hope I was captured in that rise!

  ** indiepenguins
     so, with 10.5mil active players, that brings us to around 375k
     lnx players? and the rounding error was good for about 35k?

  ** Crespyl
     Do we know if Steam Play sessions still count as Linux? At least
     as far as whatever distribution stats the devs/publishers will
     see?

     ** Matty_R
        Yes, Steam Play counts towards Linux.


     ** FurbyOnSteroid
        AFAIK Steam doesn't count these stats if you play games on
        certain operating systems. All they count is the survey you
        get every now and then (APPARENTLY.. I never got one on
        linux). So it shouldn't matter how you play your games.
        I thought you meant the statistics of the stat page. My bad.


     ** aaronfranke
        Steam Play counts as Linux but Steam in Wine counts as
        Windows.

        ** toidiboy
           Not true Steam wine counts as Linux or "other" depending
           on your setup. Has done for some years. It was also
           mentioned earlier in this thread.



  ** kingpers
     And that including me 😁

  ** VisceralMonkey
     Haha, oh man.

  ** not_usually_serious
     nah its because I installed kubuntu on my gaming machine

     ** PolygonKiwii
        Ah, I see you are also one of the 1428 and a half users of
        Steam.


  ** Leopard1907
     That happens from time to time. A few months back , opposite of
     that happened. After a fix , Linux numbers dropped.

  ** mithron
     Those percents are misleading: they hide a big userbase that is
     greater than almost any game has. Yes, it's still a minority,
     but as with minorities that also has some beneficial
     implications. It's easier to get bigger traction. Also I wonder
     if there is a general genre bias in Linux userbase, but that
     probably cannot be researched as per-game Linux users stats are
     not published.

     ** PM_ME_PC_GAME_KEYS
        Those percents are misleading: they hide a big userbase that
        is greater than almost any game has.
        How exactly do they "hide" the GNU/Linux userbase? Just
        because there's a small number (percentage) describing
        something that could also be described with a big number
        (count of users)? Or am I missing something?

        ** MNfrstrtD
           How exactly do they "hide" the GNU/Linux userbase?
           If they offer 15,000 titles, IDK how many they really do
           offer, and have 20 million subscribers with .78% using
           "GNU/Linux" you would think that GNU/Linux is a small
           segment maybe not worth developing software for. Yet if
           those .78% total userbase subscribers only play 10 titles,
           and of those 10 titles, 1 or 2 titles have 30% GNU/Linux
           userbase, than you have an obscured number. Especially if
           those 1 or 2 titles are in the top 10 most popular games
           on Steam.
           Another way that .78% can be misleading is if the
           GNU/Linux crowd as a whole counts for a higher ratio of
           income than other players, and/or are as a whole spending
           more time per week than other groups. Let's say that the
           overwhelming majority of GNU/Linux users spend 22 hours a
           week using Steam where as only 5% of Windows users spend
           20 hours or more playing Steam per week.
           
           There are other metrics that can be easily exploited. My
           point is that maybe if it were reported in a more
           meaningful way, such as by reporting on how GNU/Linux
           gamers compare in metrics the Steam executives use to
           decide whether to continue supporting or even expanding
           services for the GNU/Linux market, we could all appreciate
           whether .78% is really a good thing, or a sign that we
           still on the fringe.

        Possibly. Fedora is reported as "Linux 4.x". :)


  ** Aka_Erus
     Just thinking about how many "Windows users" are actually
     running Windows Steam through wine or even using
     virtualisation...
     We won't get true numbers.

  ** der_pelikan
     I just calculated how long it would take to take windows 96% if
     we continue to grow with 31% a month: 19 months. 2020 will be
     the year of total linux gaming domination ;)
