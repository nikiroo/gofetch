		Hi! I have league of legends all set up on my desktop pc, running arch with proprietary nvidia drivers, and all I had to run the game is winetricks d3dx9. Now I try to install it on my arch laptop as well, but this time the game crashes when it tries to run (the launcher works as intended tho). So I tried a million thing to eventually find that winetricks directx9 works. Now the game runs surprisingly well for a 13&quot; laptop with only intel integrated graphics. So my question is: whats the difference between the d3dx9 winetricks package and the directx9 one? I noticed d3dx9 never spawns any ui, while the directx9 package prompts an old looking install wizard. My theory is that d3dx9 is just a part of the directx9 package, tho I am quite confused as to why my tower needs only d3dx9 while the laptop needed another one. Thanks for any clue

    <div class='comment_content'><p>Try sticking to d3dx9_36 if you need it. Otherwise, WINE's builtin alternative should be fine. D3dx9 just extracks the components needed from the directx9 installer. Directx9 installs the whole thing, even the parts that tend to conflict with WINE.</p><p>The game on the intel laptop was probably trying to run a bit of different code for the intel chipset, something that wasn't properly handled by WINE's alternative.</p></div>
