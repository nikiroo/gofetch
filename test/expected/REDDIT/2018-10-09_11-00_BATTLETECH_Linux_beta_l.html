      <div class='comment_content'><p>Yesterday I updated a Win10 laptop that had been sitting on a shelf for two years. I could have installed a dozens systems with *buntu using a online install from a mini boot image, with all major apps installed and updated, in the time it took Win10 to finish its updates, update reattempts, and dozen or so reboots. What's worse is that most of the Win10 updates were either for the OS or Office only. Any Linux package manager updates nearly everything and Steam handles most of the rest.</p></div>

      <div class='comment_content'><p>AV is the worst offender because it hooks into all I/O. But there's also significant overhead in NTFS when dealing with many small files. It's partially the cost of the much more involved security model on NT (and ACL processing). That's why compiling has an extreme performance penalty on Windows, since it reads and writes many small files.</p></div>

      <div class='comment_content'><p>Linux is pretty good when it comes to utilizing (otherwise) free memory, using it to cache ("buffer") parts of your drives. Just try to do an reading-intensive I/O task, like find / -name stdio.h . The first may take a while, but then just rerun the command. It's much quicker, because Linux cached (in this case) the file structure the first time, and now can just quickly grab it from there again for the second time.</p><p>Want to see the caching of files (and not structures) in action? Find any medium sized file (about a gigabyte in size). Now, call md5sum path/to/the/file on it. Call it again afterwards. It should be much faster.</p><p>Don't have such a file handy? You can generate a "large.file" using dd if=/dev/zero of=large.file bs=4096 count=262144 . Do note that by doing this, Linux will already have (all or parts of) the file cached, the difference between both calls should be much smaller.</p><p>A much more file-centric system basically requires a good I/O cache to get good performance. Crucial for slow spinning drives (or worse, magnetic drives), but still really important for SSDs.</p></div>

    <div class='comment_content'><p>Now, maybe they're not comparing fresh load to fresh load, but it wouldn't at all surprise me if it was true when comparing second+ load to second+ load as Linux has always shined very brightly when it came to caching games to RAM better than Windows.

In a way, the devs are working around something of a Windows weakness by doing that (though it's a performance win in general).</p><p>That's a common pattern -- developers architect the game to work around Windows weaknesses, and of course don't take advantage of the strengths on Linux/POSIX. In principle someone could go the other direction, and design for some of POSIX/Linux strengths; I've pondered the topic in posts here before but neither I nor anyone else has a coherent thesis on the topic yet.</p></div>

              <div class='comment_content'><p>The short version is that the PDP-10 is a very large 36-bit mainframe, and the PDP-11 is a 16-bit minicomputer that only took up a couple of racks originally -- a small fraction of the physical size. Even thought the model lines sound similar, they were very different product lines that were used for different purposes.</p><p>PDP-11s were the second model of computer to run Unix, and the place where most of Unix was invented. Only PDP-11s ran Unix until the late 1970s. Later, the most popular hardware to run Unix were VAXes, the 32-bit replacement for the venerable PDP-11s. DEC didn't really like it when customers bought their hardware but not their operating systems. Unix never ran on 36-bit machines. The big tens are rather unique in history.</p><p>However, the command-line syntax was quite similar on all of the DEC operating systems. Kildall used much of it in CP/M, and through that path, much of it went into DOS. DOS also inherited a bit of syntax from Xenix, which Microsoft had licensed a year or two prior to the IBM PC project.</p><p>Microsoft wanted to license Xenix to the different OEM computer manufacturers, and sell their apps for Xenix in addition to other operating systems, prior to the IBM PC opportunity falling into their laps. Microsoft did continue to make apps for other operating systems, most fervently MacOS, the home of Excel. Word was on Xenix first, and only much later came to the Mac and to the fledgling Windows.</p><p>Unix was originally invented for gaming and word processing, and Microsoft Word was originally made for Unix. History is stranger than you think.</p></div>

            <div class='comment_content'><p>As long as you have a backup somewhere of all your important stuff! Since HDDs are big and cheap I prefer just using one big one. Hell, there are 10TB ones out now and higher.</p><p>These are the two largest drives I have. I used to have Win10 on the 1TB and used the 2TB to record gaming videos. When I wanted to switch I realized I could just drop Linux on the 2TB drive and have the 1TB Win10 to fall back to if my litmus test for Linux wasn't passed this time around (Warframe & WoW being playable).</p><p>Being able to merge the 1TB into the file system is just an added bonus for when I'm ready to get rid of the safety blanket. Been a month and I think I've thought about booting to that drive... once? But the desire to try Destiny 2 again passed. :)</p></div>

      <div class='comment_content'><p>Linux loading times being faster for many games, especially during 2nd+ loads, is 100% confirmed. As for this particular game, other users have confirmed the same thing within this very post.</p><p>So, while wanting evidence is amiable, we already have it.</p></div>

        <div class='comment_content'><p>I mean sure. And there are plenty of benchmarks to show it. I just think "10 times" is a bit excessive and random. I dunno. Am not trying to crap on your joke either.</p></div>

          <div class='comment_content'><p>I don't know how accurate "10" is hehe, but some of the benchmark videos show huge differences, so I totally get someone say "10 times faster". But we don't have to be overly anal, they just mean it's "much faster" I'm sure, and that much is confirmed.</p><p>Nothing against anal. :3</p></div>
