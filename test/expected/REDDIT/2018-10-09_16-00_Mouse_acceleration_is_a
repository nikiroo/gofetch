    All  Linux  distributions  I have used required me to tweak the
    mouse settings before it was usable for gaming.
    
    Stock  Ubuntu for example comes with mouse acceleration enabled
    by default and there is no option to turn it off. WTF?
    
    Even  on touchpads mouse acceleration feels like its doing more
    harm than good and I dont like it :(

    charity or GNU developers.


  ** TurnDownForTendies
     Despite the downvotes this is a legitimate complaint. I've never
     understood why this isn't extremely easy to disable.

     ** KarKraKr
        There even was a time when libinput didn't support flat
        acceleration at all while some distros (namely arch) had
        already moved to it. I downgraded that package immediately.
        If I remember correctly the devs were quite dismissive of
        this and didn't think it was a high priority, because who
        doesn't want mouse acceleration? And isn't setting it to some
        really low value just like turning it off?
        No, it's not and yes I notice it immediately. I refuse to buy
        many mice because they can't track without some leftover
        acceleration ffs. With Linux being more and more viable as a
        gaming platform this just can't be ignored. I know people who
        tried switching to Linux because they heard CSGO, the only
        game they ever play, runs. They were just as stupefied as
        you'd expect them to be that there was no option for
        disabling mouse acceleration completely and that they had to
        manually edit config files. "Yeah, Linux is really easy these
        days, uhh, except for that I guess"

        If you use Gnome or especially KDE, it is extremely easy to
        disable. Just go to the settings menu and disable it.

        ** aaronfranke
           In XFCE there's a menu for changing the acceleration
           amount, but it doesn't do anything if I set it to zero or
           ten.

                    That's pretty shocking. If you're not resource
                    limited, I'd consider moving to KDE since they
                    actually seem to care about what the users want
                    and need.

                    ** aaronfranke
                       Not shocking to me. Ubuntu and Wine both have
                       bugs over a decade old. I just checked and KDE
                       has open bugs from 2002. Tends to happen with
                       open-source projects. [1]The oldest 500 bugs
                       are from 2002 to 2005 .
                       XFCE's oldest bug is from 2006. Gnome's oldest
                       bug is from 2004. The Linux kernel's oldest
                       bug is from 2005. Wine's oldest bug is from
                       2000.

                          It's shocking considering the kind of bug
                          it is.


                       ** Greydmiyu
                          Most might not be valid any longer. I was
                          putzing around with Dokuwiki at work, it
                          didn't install cleanly from the package. So
                          I checked the bugtracker for the package.
                          Oldest bug for Dokuwiki is filed against
                          8.10. That version isn't even supported any
                          more (16.04LTS is the oldest, I think). On
                          top of that the specific bug is fixed. I
                          know it's fixed. The current package isn't
                          missing the symlink that bug says is
                          missing.

                          Tends to happen with open-source projects.
                          Tends to happen more with closed source
                          projects as there is no way to report or
                          track bugs open to the public. Windows 7
                          was still running 16 bit dos... Think about
                          how old the bugs must be in that pile of
                          trash.
                          One of them led to a full privilege

                          That's an issue with bug triaging, not bug
                          fixing.

                          ** aaronfranke
                             The user doesn't care though.

                             ** the_Madman
                                That's correct. They don't care about
                                bug reports against software that
                                doesn't have the bug anymore.








           ** hatestetris
              Same issue on MATE.



        ** TurnDownForTendies
           I made a bootable usb to see the mouse options in KDE.
           You're right there's an option to set the acceleration to
           flat. The last time I used it I was confused by the
           multipliers where you could type in values for
           acceleration and "pointer threshold." Good to see its now
           just a click to get it over with.

           ** 5had0w5talk3r
              Yeah, the KDE team have done a great job recently and
              have developed a modern, feature-rich, and great
              performing desktop with some of the best apps in the
              Linux space. It's really come a long way and I have
              zero regrets or complaints after having switched to it
              over a year ago.

              ** TurnDownForTendies
                 Yeah looks a lot different than it used to last time
                 I tried it a year ago. Looks really nice so far and
                 animations are a lot smoother than what I'm used to
                 on gnome. I had to edit a file to stop screen
                 tearing on my nvidia card and disallow applications
                 to block compositing because running a game would
                 cause window dragging and some desktop effects to
                 get screwed up, but I'll switch to it if things seem
                 stable.

                    I had to edit a file to stop screen tearing on my
                    nvidia card
                    On any recent drivers you can just open the
                    nvidia-settings tool as root and enable
                    "ForceFullCompositePipeline" under "Advanced" in
                    the "X Server Display Configuration". Then just
                    save it to your xorg.conf file to keep it after a
                    reboot.
                    
                    disallow applications to block compositing
                    because running a game would cause window
                    dragging and some desktop effects to get screwed
                    up,
                    This seems to be an edge-case with only certain
                    applications. IIRC, the only one I've encountered
                    any issues with was [1]The Adventures of Fei
                    Duanmu . In any case, you can manually toggle
                    compositing using a global shortcut
                    (Shift+Alt+F12 by default).
                    
                    Looks really nice so far and animations are a lot
                    smoother than what I'm used to on gnome.
                    Yeah the animations and transitions are great.
                    You can customize them too, from "Smoother and
                    longer" to "Snappier and shorter" (or just turn
                    them off if that's your thing).

                       Seeing as how we are on a gaming subreddit:
                       keep in mind that this does have a huge
                       performance impact.

                       ** 5had0w5talk3r
                          I feel like this is a myth that keeps
                          getting perpetuated. I've done testing and
                          have seen no impact in either frame-time,
                          response, or frame-rate across OpenGL,
                          Vulkan or Wine games. Maybe it causes some
                          issue in some edge-case game where the code
                          is poorly optimized, but I've yet to run
                          into it.

                          ** DutchHawk_
                             Dunno about edge case, but it isn't
                             consistent: that's true.
                             I have little impact in say
                             Insurgency/DOF, but both Tomb Raiders
                             had massive stuttering. Same with the
                             vsync effect: sometimes it seems to
                             clamp it to 60fps while other games are
                             fine.
                             So I guess the advice would more be
                             "keep in mind it does stuff; if you have
                             issues try enabling/disabling it".



                       ** GaianNeuron
                          There's an option in KDE called "allow
                          applications to block compositing" which
                          lets games override that and recover said
                          performance.
                          It's enabled by default.

                          ** DutchHawk_
                             From what I gather, that has nothing to
                             do with Nvidia's settings (inc. any form
                             of CompositePipeline ) only KDE's own
                             compositing. KWin doesn't know anything
                             what Nvidia is doing. Via former KDE dev
                             [1]/u/mgraesslin : see [2]this
                             The [3]solution in that thread by
                             [4]/u/UrbenLegend may work with the
                             "block compositing" (since it it a KWin
                             thingy after all). Although for me the
                             triple buffer helps, but not completely
                             eliminates tearing.

           KDE has different mouse settings menus depending on the
           driver, so that option isn't always there. It wasn't for
           me by default.

           ** Walrad_Usingen
              Yes! [1]Here is a forum post showing the different
              mouse settings in the preferences. Make sure you
              install xf86-input-evdev and use it instead of the
              default xf86-input-libinput , e.g. with cp

                 Maybe symlink the file instead of copying so it
                 doesn't get out of sync when the original gets
                 updated.

                 ** Walrad_Usingen
                    Yeah, probably not a bad idea. I don't
                    necessarily trust the package keeping it in the
                    same place either though, so maybe both. 🤔

              When was this? It's there on the default configuration
              for: Fedora 28, Arch (and Arch-based), Kubuntu 18.04,
              KDE Neon.



        ** Jupon
           wait, with KDE i can completely disable this? im
           installing this weekend!



     ** Swiftpaw22
        It is, and it's why I helped to get the Linux Mint developers
        to turn it off by default. There is an option in mouse
        settings for "custom acceleration" where you can turn it back
        on, though, if you want it. But seriously, most everyone
        seems to prefer it off, hence why they changed that. It's
        stupid to have accel be the default, and even if you make it
        the default, at least provide a way to easily disable it.
        All distros should do the same. No mouse acceleration is a
        sane default.

        ** Jupon
           When was this? i was using mint earlier this year and it
           was impossible for someone like me to remove.


        ** chunes
           As someone who moved from Windows to Mint a few weeks ago,
           thank you! This thread had me worried but I was surprised
           to see it turned off by default.

           ** TheFlyingDharma
              Disabling mouse acceleration is a "massively niche
              feature"? Did I really just read that on a gaming
              subreddit?

                 I am yet to meet anyone IRL that remotely cares
                 about this. And most of the people I know are geeks
                 to some degree.
                 Reality is that most of the people don't care, and
                 if we added this feature to the UI they would feel
                 confused about it and mess it up and then wonder why
                 their mouse is acting glitchy on Linux.
                 If instead, we leave it like it is, the people who
                 care can run the terminal commands or install the
                 right packages or whatever.

        Yeah thats the solution on stock Ubuntu but you shouldnt have
        to install software to change mouse settings...

        ** redstoolthrowawayy
           Actually the function is already part of gnome, the tweak
           tool makes it easier to access and saves the setting.

              ** furquan_ahmad
                 Debian (on which Ubuntu is based upon) installs it
                 as part of the gnome metapackage, I don't know why
                 Ubuntu removed Tweaks from the metapackage.

                    My guess would be to "simplify" the experience.

              ** ImpersonalComputer
                 You had to install gnome tweak tool to change the

                 manually by editing dconf.

                 ** TMiguelT
                    Any idea why tweak tool is not installed by

                    dialogue? It's so helpful I don't understand why

                       Because that gives users control, which is
                       against the Gnome philosophy.

                       ** Vash63
                          Gnome doesn't decide on the default
                          packages for a distribution. As mentioned
                          above in this same comment thread, Ubuntu's
                          upstream (Debian) does include Tweaks by
                          default with the 'gnome' metapackage.

                          ** the_Madman
                             Gnome does decide to ship 4 different
                             UIs to do one job, and all as separate
                             software.

                                True, but that isn't the same thing
                                you initially said which is that they
                                don't like giving control. They just
                                aren't organizing it very well.






                 ** lordofbud
                    I think the point they are making is that it's
                    not a default GUI option, people who are just
                    switching over from windows, and doing so as
                    gamers are likely not familiar with non-GUI
                    methods of adjusting settings.
                    [1]This is what they see on Ubuntu, and to be
                    honest, it leaves the impression to a new user
                    that disabling mouse acceleration is not an
                    option.

                       I agree, it should be a part of Ubuntu’s basic
                       features I was just trying to clarify that it
                       can be done without installing the gnome tweak
                       tools package.

              ** BulletDust
                 Microsoft could have used just the 'Control Panel'
                 as opposed to the 'Control Panel' and the 'Settings
                 Panel' couldn't they?
                 A classic example of a non intuitive GUI if I ever
                 saw one. It's easier opening a configuration file
                 and copy/pasting simple text.




        ** FlukyS
           Well they are shipping the Gnome settings manager with a

        Does that really turn it off though? I've never seen a GUI

        such an option.

     Then you haven't used Linux Mint, as I helped to get the

     back on, though, if you want it. But seriously, most everyone

     All distros should do the same. No mouse acceleration is a sane
     default.

  ** jensreuterberg
     Ok this may be the DUMBEST question - but I use the GUI option
     in plasma to set flat acceleration rate - but then I do
     
     $ xinput list-props {1..50} 2>/dev/null | fgrep 'libinput Accel
     Profile Enabled ('
     And it claims acceleration is still on... (ie reads 1, 0 instead
     of 0, 1)
     Is it me just not getting it, or freaking out for nothing? If
     not: Why?
     EDIT: should be noted that I have a hard time checking
     "manually" (ie testing going quick over the same space as you've
     recently dragged it slowly to see if it goes "farther" when
     moving fast) but my aim in CSGO "feels" shaky. Could be just me
     stressing out and getting shaky aim due to that suspicion.

     ** AI221
        best way to test is to set 2 heavy objects between your mouse
        and move between them fast or slow. If your mouse doesn't
        return to roughly the same spot you're good.(unless you've
        got some $500 mouse it's not gonna be pixel-perfect)

        ** jensreuterberg
           Thats the one I usually do (although not THAT heavy), will
           do some more of it though just to calm my nerves - which
           may just as well be what messes it up. CS is such a
           "confidence game", and a small streak of losses really
           makes you wonder and question etc etc...



     ** Sasamus
        You are correct. The profile toggle does not work, at least
        for some, the profile does not change.


  ** K900_
     KDE Plasma lets you disable mouse acceleration out of the box.

     ** iommu
        Does it have an option for sensitivity yet? On 5.13 I could
        only find accel but not sensitivity.

        ** AimlesslyWalking
           I think the acceleration option might just be a poorly
           worded sensitivity option, so long as you set it to flat
           profile underneath. I could be wrong though, just going
           off a brief mouse-feel test and it feels unaccelerated.

           ** RASQ37
              Just tested it. No, it's definitely acceleration.

              ** Sasamus
                 That slider does work as a sensitivity/speed slider
                 with a flat profile.
                 The problem is that changing the profile there
                 doesn't seem to work for some people, hence why
                 people have different experiences.
                 If you set the profile to flat by other means that
                 slider can be used for sensitivity.





     ** raist356
        I guess you are using the stable version. That option is gone
        in the settings of new versions.

        ** K900_
           It's there for me on Plasma 5.14 beta.

        ** jensreuterberg

           (Flat Acceleration Rate checkbox underneath the slider)

           Switched to Linux full-time a couple of months for gaming
           (everything else I had been doing on Unix for ages
           anyway), set my mouse settings to something that felt
           nice[1] and no issues after one or two days.

  ** plumkefan
     Just to be a bit pedantic, this is not a Linux issue as it has
     nothing to do with the kernel. It is really an issue with
     whatever Desktop Environment(s) you are using.
     Some DEs have this built into to their settings UI, some do not.
     If there is a specific DE you love, but does not offer this,
     propose it upstream and someone may add it in.
     There are several options for persistently disabling
     acceleration. The easiest that come to mind would be either
     throwing an computer command in somewhere like .xprofile or
     specifying your mouse parameters in an XOrg config file. If
     using Gnome, there is always gnome-tweaks, as has been
     mentioned.
     From what I’ve read in this thread, it seems like half the
     commenters are expecting that there should be some magic
     software or standard UI element that is mandatory in every
     distribution of Linux. It’s a bit silly to think that way as
     everyone uses Linux in their own way and many of us don’t want
     bloated garbage that we will never use (a UI element for a
     setting that only needs to be touched once).

        Just a reminder, but you do understand you've written this in
        a sub called linux _gaming, right? Nobody cares at this
        point, from a casual user's perspective, linux is just a
        catch-all term for linux distros.

        While I personally love config files, manually configuring
        some settings can be intimidating for newcomers and it gets
        even worse when you also have to setup multiple non-binary
        vars that only accept specific values (ie dpi, sensitivity,
        acceleration etc).

        You're spot on regarding unnecessary cruft bloating a default
        installation. However if a noob-friendly desktop-use distro
        (or rather DE) already provides a basic mouse configuration
        utility in its system settings I think it would really make
        sense if they could merely add a couple of additional
        elements to expose and configure stuff like this.
        The thing is, not all peripherals can be supported through
        the same utilities (at least not for stuff like dpi), but
        thankfully bosic stuff like acceleration are merely handled
        by libinput (and others).
        On the other hand, libinput doesn't even expose proper
        configuration files, so if you're on Wayland and your
        compositor doesn't provide a tool to modify acceleration and
        other parameters you're pretty much stuck with the default
        settings!

                 I personally think you've set the bar a little low
                 considering the technical ability of most gamers. I
                 enjoy gaming and I had mouse acceleration disabled
                 permanently in seconds under Ubuntu MATE.

                 ** Greydmiyu
                    I've hated mouse acceleration ever since it was
                    introduced. I've never had to "move the mouse
                    over half the table." Called tweaking sensitivity
                    for the available space. Right now the mouse I am
                    using for my laptop has less area than a standard
                    sized hot pad (7"x7"). I only use that as a unit
                    of measurement because my dinner is on a hot pad
                    next to the mouse and takes up more room than
                    what my mouse has to move.


                 ** TurbulentCurrent
                    I don't use acceleration and my mouse has to move
                    less than 4 cm for the pointer to move from one
                    corner to the diagonally opposite corner on a
                    1080p screen.

                    I have never heard someone praise mouse
                    acceleration, I have on the other hand heard
                    people bitch about it.

                    You're literally the only person I've ever seen
                    defend mouse acceleration. I don't think that
                    number is as high as you think it is. That shit
                    is cancer. Just up the sensitivity a little bit
                    if you can't be bothered to move your hand a few
                    inches FFS.

     I guess that explains why I always find the mouse sluggish on

  ** walterbanana
     Just like Windows, to be fair. Nowadays you can change the
     acceleration profile in Gnome Tweak tool, if you are using Gnome
     anyway.

  ** Appofia
     Flat in KDE does not disable acceleration as some people are
     claiming, at least not for me, there's still acceleration
     present it's just a different curve, or it's bugged.
     Not having proper GUI settings for mouse controls is my number 1
     issue with running Linux these days. It's baffling why something
     that so many people want to change/adjust has to be done with
     editing files or creating scripts.

     ** Sasamus
        It's bugged, at least for some, the profile settings does not
        change the profile.


  ** paanordpolen
     Long live xinput commands

  ** cloudrac3r
     Play around with the xinput command-line tool. Specifically,
     Device Accel Profile (aceleration type) and Device Accel
     Constant Deceleration (speed). My preferred settings are -1 and
     1.25 respectively, and I have this script to set them for me:
     a="$(xinput | grep 'Logitech USB Receiver' | awk '{print $6}' |
     sed 's/id=//')"
     for i in $a; do
     b="$(xinput list-props $i | grep 'Device Accel Constant
     Deceleration')"
     b=${b##*(}
     b=${b%%)*}
     xinput set-prop $i $b 1.25
     b="$(xinput list-props $i | grep 'Device Accel Profile')"
     b=${b##*(}
     b=${b%%)*}
     xinput set-prop $i $b -1
     done
     For a synaptics touchpad, use the synclient command line tool.

  ** gluka_
     It's true and in KDE at least, setting the slider to zero
     doesn't actually give you raw input like xorg configs will (it
     feels smoothed). From what I can tell, there's also no real
     option for changing your desktop sensitivity once you're rid of
     mouse acceleration if you don't have working DPI settings.
     Changing the transform matrix through xinput seems like the best
     solution, but causes the camera to spin uncontrollably in a ton
     of games for some reason.
     
     I suppose you could make a script to disable/enable it as
     needed, but most games have menus and overlays that you need to
     interact with regularly so that would be a lot of hotkey presses
     over time.

     ** 5had0w5talk3r
        in KDE at least, setting the slider to zero doesn't actually
        give you raw input
        Did you set your profile to 'flat'?


     ** Sasamus
        With the adaptive profile the slider adjusts the amount of
        acceleration.
        With the flat profile the slider adjusts the
        sensitivity/speed.
        The problem is that the profile setting doesn't seem to work,
        at least for some.
        But the slider works as it should if you set the profile in
        other ways.

     Shouldn't it be in the game settings anyway?

  ** Zach_Attakk
     I don't know if it's because I'm used to the "enhanced pointer
     precision" on Windows, but every time I go back to my Zorin
     machine, I keep overshooting buttons, even when moving slowly.
     I'd also like to be able to set the sensitivity of my mouse vs
     my trackpad independently, because one is super slow and the
     other super fast and I don't want to switch it every time I
     decide not to plug in the mouse.

  ** TurbulentCurrent
     On X you can easily disable it by typing xset m 1 0
     in the terminal
     But on Wayland (libinput), I have not found a way to disable it,
     that's why I don't use any distro that comes with Wayland.

     ** Saizaku_
        Just to stop missinformatiom from spreading, xset no longer
        works the way it used to due to the changes in x. You should
        use config files, read more about that here:

     Honestly, most people probably want it on, so having to use some
     google searches to turn it off is not a very big deal.

     ** lordofbud
        Not trying to bash you, but if you're using a physical mouse
        instead of a touch pad, why would you want mouse acceleration
        on?
        It out right annoys me, the first thing I set out to address
        on a fresh install is disabling it.

        ** inverimus
           I don't have it on, but I think most people do not bother
           ever turning it off and are used to it being on all the
           time.



     ** MightyWheatley
        still, there should be an easy to find option for those who
        want to turn it off


  ** Prime624
     Huh. I actually love the mouse sensitivity and acceleration on
     Linux (and Mac). I can barely use a windows mouse anymore, it's
     so touchy or sluggish, no good balance.

     ** volca02
        It's okay if you do - but there are those with high-dpi mice
        used to RAW input without any acceleration - and I'm one of
        them. It's mind boggling why the common desktop environments
        don't allow for total bypass of the mouse input processing.


     ** LordMacharius
        I prefer accuracy, mouse acceleration on a mouse is the most
        frustrating thing to work with.


  ** the_Madman
     KDE's mouse settings panel allows you to set the acceleration to
     "dynamic"or "flat". I switched it off the first chance I got.

  ** 84521
     Is that why the mouse is so fucky in Ubuntu? And no way to
     toggle it off?

  ** ReadAParadox
     You can disable it in Ubuntu but it's kinda complicated, first
     install gnome-tweak-tool then go to mouse settings (in
     gnome-tweak-tool) then change acceleration profile from whatever
     it is to flat.

  ** UltimaN3rd
     I installed Ubuntu 18.04 fresh just a few weeks ago and don't

     before but it seems like they changed it?

  ** BenkiTheBuilder
     I'm just using plain X11 with Fluxbox (on Ubuntu Xenial) and
     haven't changed anything regarding mouse. And I'm happy with how
     the cursor moves. Guess it's an anti-feature of Desktop
     Environments.

  ** mao_dze_dun
     I have absolutely no idea why you got ANY downvotes. This has
     been a legitimate problem that has been present on, at least,
     all Ubuntu based distros I've used. They want to increase market
     share but can't fix the effing mouse? What the hell?

  ** stormicex
     It's the reason I still use windows. Even if I disable the mouse
     acceleration from tweak tool the feel of the mouse is horrible
     in csgo. I tried 5 years ago and tried again some months ago.
     Still shit. We'll see in another 5 years lol

     ** LordMacharius
        You can't be bothered to look up the software you need so you
        use Windows instead, wtf?

        ** stormicex
           maybe you need to read again my post. Even with
           acceleration disabled mouse feels weird on linux compared
           to what feel on windows. Aim is super important while
           playing csgo and if my mouse don't feel precise i can't
           play on linux.
