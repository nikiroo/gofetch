    ive  always  noticed  that  stuff  loads  much  faster on Linux
    compared to windows, can someone explain why?

        Better filesystem's, better IO scheduling, better scheduling
        in general, less chances of some stupid ass av to clog up all
        the io is what I've found.

           Unless you open calculator on Ubuntu. It's comical
           actually.

           Also what appears to be more aggressive caching, and less
           bloat to burn through memory that would otherwise be
           cached.
           I've note looked too carefully at it, but Windows machines
           usually appear to have a whole lot of free memory, and
           relatively little cached.
           Meanwhile, my laptop has 10GB of "stuff" just floating
           around in memory in case I happen to want it.

        Yesterday I updated a Win10 laptop that had been sitting on a
        shelf for two years. I could have installed a dozens systems
        with *buntu using a online install from a mini boot image,
        with all major apps installed and updated, in the time it
        took Win10 to finish its updates, update reattempts, and
        dozen or so reboots. What's worse is that most of the Win10
        updates were either for the OS or Office only. Any Linux
        package manager updates nearly everything and Steam handles
        most of the rest.


     ** Batolemaeus
        AV is the worst offender because it hooks into all I/O. But
        there's also significant overhead in NTFS when dealing with
        many small files. It's partially the cost of the much more
        involved security model on NT (and ACL processing). That's
        why compiling has an extreme performance penalty on Windows,
        since it reads and writes many small files.


     ** aaronfranke
        In addition to what's already been said, EXT4 doesn't
        fragment nearly as much as NTFS.


     ** Craftkorb
        Linux is pretty good when it comes to utilizing (otherwise)
        free memory, using it to cache ("buffer") parts of your
        drives. Just try to do an reading-intensive I/O task, like
        find / -name stdio.h . The first may take a while, but then
        just rerun the command. It's much quicker, because Linux
        cached (in this case) the file structure the first time, and
        now can just quickly grab it from there again for the second
        time.
        Want to see the caching of files (and not structures) in
        action? Find any medium sized file (about a gigabyte in
        size). Now, call md5sum path/to/the/file on it. Call it again
        afterwards. It should be much faster.
        Don't have such a file handy? You can generate a "large.file"
        using dd if=/dev/zero of=large.file bs=4096 count=262144 . Do
        note that by doing this, Linux will already have (all or
        parts of) the file cached, the difference between both calls
        should be much smaller.
        A much more file-centric system basically requires a good I/O
        cache to get good performance. Crucial for slow spinning
        drives (or worse, magnetic drives), but still really
        important for SSDs.


     ** robot_rover
        It’s because windows search and windows compatibility
        telemetry are currently using 100% or ur hard disk time


  ** JackCourtney
     Not a game, but GIMP loads so much faster on linux than windows

     ** 8bitcerberus
        Pretty much all of them, GIMP, Krita, Inkscape, Scribus,
        Kdenlive, Blender, etc. Faster than Windows and way faster
        than OS X. Blender is probably the closest I've seen between
        the 3 OSes, but it's still measurably faster on Linux, the
        others though, there's no contest.


     ** pooerh
        Yeah that's probably mostly because you have gtk libs in
        shared memory from either other open apps or even your entire
        DE, while GIMP is the only thing that needs them on Windows.

        ** one_is_the_loneliest
           Don't Windows apps typically bundle their own deps, so
           you'll end up with several of the same dep in memory at a
           time?
           However, libraries are typically pretty small, so I'm
           guessing it doesn't explain most of the difference, but
           it's certainly a contributor.

           ** pooerh
              Whole UI libraries like gtk or Qt are pretty big
              actually, which is why they usually start slower on
              Windows than on Linux. Most Windows apps are written
              using either Win32 API or .net and these aren't bundled
              with apps, these usually start up pretty quickly.

              ** one_is_the_loneliest
                 Huh, I just figured that Windows apps would bundle
                 their UI libs, but I guess that makes sense.





  ** Swiftpaw22
     Now, maybe they're not comparing fresh load to fresh load, but
     it wouldn't at all surprise me if it was true when comparing
     second+ load to second+ load as Linux has always shined very
     brightly when it came to caching games to RAM better than
     Windows. Secondary loads in most of the games I've seen load
     faster than on Windows.

     ** pdp10
        Both the Linux storage I/O subsystem and the Linux
        filesystems themselves are known to be faster than Windows
        NTFS.
        On the majority of modern games you don't see much of a
        difference, though, because the assets are packed into
        ordered binary files and then memory-mapped. In a way, the
        devs are working around something of a Windows weakness by
        doing that (though it's a performance win in general).
        That's a common pattern -- developers architect the game to
        work around Windows weaknesses, and of course don't take
        advantage of the strengths on Linux/POSIX. In principle
        someone could go the other direction, and design for some of
        POSIX/Linux strengths; I've pondered the topic in posts here
        before but neither I nor anyone else has a coherent thesis on
        the topic yet.

        ** s0v3r1gn
           The largest differences between EXT4 and NTFS that affects
           the I/O are the maximum cluster size and the
           “allocate-on-flush” method of allocating disk space.
           The latest version of NTFS substantially increased the
           maximum cluster size and both the cluster size and the
           “allocate-on-flush” method are substantially less
           impactful on loading times on SSDs than they were on HDDs.
           The largest difference in load times is probably caused by
           Windows memory management being far more zealous in
           purging garbage.

           ** piotrj3
              This. On loading screen there is a lot of memory
              allocation and thread creation and so on and this is
              where linux is faster.



        ** Tom2Die
           I've pondered the topic in posts here before but neither I
           nor anyone else has a coherent thesis on the topic yet.
           I have faith that some day when you mature a bit more and
           become a PDP-11 you'll find the answers you seek.

           ** pdp10
              And drop 20 bits from the word?

              ** Tom2Die
                 Wait, did they really? There must be a good reason,
                 but I'm not too familiar with older tech.

                 ** pdp10
                    The short version is that the PDP-10 is a very
                    large 36-bit mainframe, and the PDP-11 is a
                    16-bit minicomputer that only took up a couple of
                    racks originally -- a small fraction of the
                    physical size. Even thought the model lines sound
                    similar, they were very different product lines
                    that were used for different purposes.
                    PDP-11s were the second model of computer to run
                    Unix, and the place where most of Unix was
                    invented. Only PDP-11s ran Unix until the late
                    1970s. Later, the most popular hardware to run
                    Unix were VAXes, the 32-bit replacement for the
                    venerable PDP-11s. DEC didn't really like it when
                    customers bought their hardware but not their
                    operating systems. Unix never ran on 36-bit
                    machines. The big tens are rather unique in
                    history.
                    However, the command-line syntax was quite
                    similar on all of the DEC operating systems.
                    Kildall used much of it in CP/M, and through that
                    path, much of it went into DOS. DOS also
                    inherited a bit of syntax from Xenix, which
                    Microsoft had licensed a year or two prior to the
                    IBM PC project.
                    Microsoft wanted to license Xenix to the
                    different OEM computer manufacturers, and sell
                    their apps for Xenix in addition to other
                    operating systems, prior to the IBM PC
                    opportunity falling into their laps. Microsoft
                    did continue to make apps for other operating
                    systems, most fervently MacOS, the home of Excel.
                    Word was on Xenix first, and only much later came
                    to the Mac and to the fledgling Windows.
                    Unix was originally invented for gaming and word
                    processing, and Microsoft Word was originally
                    made for Unix. History is stranger than you
                    think.

                    ** Tom2Die
                       The odd thing is that at one point in time I
                       knew most of that, but it's the sort of trivia
                       that if one doesn't engage with it it just
                       vanishes from memory without notice.







  ** ihjyuhgyhhg
     Can confirm, witcher 3 and GTA sa loading on Linux is
     unbelievably faster than windows.

     ** sixsupersonic
        Which is interesting considering those are windows games
        running in wine.

        ** ihjyuhgyhhg
           Exactly and also w3 runs at 24fps compared to 29fps on
           windows. It was already amazing that game was working but
           this. Linux is future.



  ** airspeedmph
     Not surprised, I have an old X-Plane benchmark where you can see
     also a striking difference in loading times (link at the
     respective test):
     [1]https://youtu.be/M5ygXe9fWR4?t=12
     I also see very long loading times on Windows for Arma3, Rust
     and a couple of others, so yeah, not surprised.
     Edit TL;DW: X-Plane scenery and all loading in 00:56 min for
     SteamOS and 02:33 min for Windows.

  ** Leopard1907
     Well , that is a known perk of Linux
     Once upon a time PenguinRecordings ( a Youtube channel ) was
     doing Linux game benchmarks.
     He was always comparing load times on Linux vs Windows. Let it
     be Feral ports or something else , always Linux was faster one.

     ** Two-Tone-
        PenguinRecordings
        I miss his benchmarks. :c

        ** Leopard1907
           Yeah , i also miss.
           His enthusiasm was really something else.
           Right after doing Doom 2016 via Wine video , he gone mute.

           ** Swiftpaw22
              Yep, sad, wonder what happened to him. Sounds like it
              may have been a side project while he was in school.

              ** Leopard1907
                 I hope he is enjoying SteamPlay like we do and
                 living his life. :)

                 ** Swiftpaw22
                    That doesn't mean we don't still need Linux game
                    benchmarking. At least we have Phoronix and a few
                    other youtube channels that do it somewhat.






  ** mykro76
     ITT - many apps and games do load faster on Linux.
     This seems like something worth promoting to game devs as a
     benefit of developing on Linux. How much time must they spend
     staring at their own loading screen when tweaking and testing
     their game?

     ** Swiftpaw22
        Good point!


  ** ThenewLore
     If it only would load the actual missions and not crash on the
     mission title...

  ** Atlas__risen
     I noticed a big improvement in FFXV on Linux vs Windows as well.

  ** Offensive_joke_lord
     My windows-using friend is always so impressed by how fast my
     games load. Well, it's happened twice, once with invisible inc
     and once with crusader kings II. I'm pretty sure his computer is
     better spec-wise as well

     ** Swiftpaw22
        On the first load, or subsequent loads, or all loads? Because
        Linux generally seems faster to load all games on subsequent
        loads at least, but also sometimes on first loads as well.

        ** Offensive_joke_lord
           Both first loads actually, we only play, and have only
           played, those games together at my house
           P.S. (yes, they're both singleplayer haha, we have fun
           playing singleplayer games and exchanging the controls.)
           P.P.S. (we even divide controls, one time we had 3 people
           and we played the binding of isaac where one person moved,
           one attacked, and the other used items)

           ** Swiftpaw22
              Cool, and sounds fun, playing together is always best!

        ** Greydmiyu
           For me it is both. But that is because when I dumped Win10
           off my gaming rig I purposely went the LVM route so I
           could clear off my largely unused SSD and make it a
           [1]cache for my HDD.
           The problem I had before was that I would get a game, put
           it on the SSD for fast loading, then move on to another
           game and not swap the games out from the SSD. With LVM
           using the SSD as a cache anything I use often gets loaded
           onto the SSD. If it ever fills up stuff I've stopped using
           gets removed from SSD. No need for me to manage it
           manually.
           Recently it has been Warframe and World of Warcraft that
           take up the bulk of my time. From boot to shutdown about
           80-90% of my file-system calls hit the SSD. I have a 120Gb
           cache for a 2Tb drive and so far it's only about 60%
           utilized.
           A few months of that without touching the Win10 drive I
           still have sitting there and I can drop the cache, add the
           1Tb of space to my volume, expand my file system, put the
           cache back on and have a 3Tb seamless logical volume to
           play with. :)

              but that clears things up, thanks!
              I guess since RAM is more expensive than a SSD, having
              the SSD cache things makes sense as long as RAM is
              still used first and foremost for file caching.
              
              have a 3Tb seamless logical volume to play with
              As long as you have a backup somewhere of all your
              important stuff! Since HDDs are big and cheap I prefer
              just using one big one. Hell, there are 10TB ones out
              now and higher.

                 These are the two largest drives I have. I used to
                 have Win10 on the 1TB and used the 2TB to record
                 gaming videos. When I wanted to switch I realized I
                 could just drop Linux on the 2TB drive and have the
                 1TB Win10 to fall back to if my litmus test for
                 Linux wasn't passed this time around (Warframe & WoW
                 being playable).
                 Being able to merge the 1TB into the file system is
                 just an added bonus for when I'm ready to get rid of
                 the safety blanket. Been a month and I think I've
                 thought about booting to that drive... once? But the
                 desire to try Destiny 2 again passed. :)

     too bad this beta won't load its own saves. i am reluctant to

     manual saves will load.

        Haven't have that issue myself, it's been working for me
        aside from some graphical glitches. Hopefully they get it
        working for everyone soon.


  ** MJBrune
     I will say while I do think there is some sort of faster load on
     linux, one user randomly staying on a forum shouldn't really be
     big news and certainly shouldn't be held as true to any real
     means.

        Linux loading times being faster for many games, especially
        during 2nd+ loads, is 100% confirmed. As for this particular
        game, other users have confirmed the same thing within this
        very post.
        So, while wanting evidence is amiable, we already have it.

           I mean sure. And there are plenty of benchmarks to show
           it. I just think "10 times" is a bit excessive and random.
           I dunno. Am not trying to crap on your joke either.

              I don't know how accurate "10" is hehe, but some of the
              benchmark videos show huge differences, so I totally
              get someone say "10 times faster". But we don't have to
              be overly anal, they just mean it's "much faster" I'm
              sure, and that much is confirmed.
              Nothing against anal. :3
