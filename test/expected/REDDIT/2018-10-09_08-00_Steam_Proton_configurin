    A  game  I've  been  eyeing  for  a  while  just  went on sale,
    [1]Pharoah  Rebirth+  ,  and  the  game  runs  fine,  except it
    doesn't  appear  to  be  able  to read or write to the joy1.ini
    file  which  defines the controls. The launcher detects gamepad
    and  keyboard  input,  but  the game does not. I have a feeling
    that   the   game  binary  expects  a  hardcoded  path  to  the
    configuration  file.  The Steam and Proton logs do not indicate
    any files missing or unreadable.
    
    I'm  wondering, if anyone has encountered path issues with game
    files while using Proton and if anyone has any fixes.
    
    For   now   I've   submitted   a  compatability  report  on  r/
    [2]http://spcr.netlify.com . I'll continue to hack on this.
    
    Thanks,
