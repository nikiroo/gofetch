    In  case  you haven't already heard about it, if you have a GOG
    account you can get Shadow Warrior 2 for free [1]here
    
    Shadow  Warrior  2 sadly didn't get a native Linux release like
    the  first  reboot but using a combination of Wine and DXVK you
    can get it running fairly smoothly (on semi outdated hardware)
    
    How to get it running
    
    The  game  got  an [2]install script for Lutris a few hours ago
    that runs by installing with the offline setup from GOG.
    
    Another  option  is  to install and run [3]GOG Galaxy which you
    can   use   to  download  and  update  the  game  and  also  to
    synchronize your savegames.
    
    [4]Here  is  a  video  demonstration  of  it  running on my cpu
    bottlenecked  hardware  (i5 2500 + 1060 3GB), so with any newer
    or overclocked CPU you should be good to go.
    
    Quick Troubleshooting (any other fixes are welcome)
    
    Game running really really slow ingame:
    
    Right   click  the  game/GOG  Galaxy  in  Lutris,  select  wine
    configuration  and in the new window set the windows version to
    windows 10
    
    If  it's still slow, right click it in Lutris, select configure
    and go to system settings. Enable 'run in terminal'
    
    Invisible Floors:
    
    Right  click  the  game  in  Lutris and make sure you have DXVK
    enabled as invisible floors usually occur in wined3d11
    
    Another  way  to check if DXVK is running and working is to set
    the environment variable DXVK_HUD to 'fps'

     Prior to the release of Shadow Warrior 2, I had purchased both
     Shadow Warrior "Classic" and Shadow Warrio, thinking I might
     play them back-to-back once I had all three.
     But after the devs/publisher reneged on a promised Linux
     release, I swore I would never buy this game. And now I don't
     have to. I can enjoy their game and they get NADA from me.
     Fuck them. Thank you GoG.
