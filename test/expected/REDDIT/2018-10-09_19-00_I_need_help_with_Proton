    Hey  guys,  its  been  several  days now that Im trying to play
    Elder  Scrolls  Online  through  proton  but  im  getting  some
    issues.
    
    I am new to linux, and that may be the major reason.
    
    I'm  running  steam in a debian 9, have updated to beta version
    and  turned  on  steam  play  settings.  At the first try after
    downloading  ESO  i've  tried  to just click play button and it
    showed  "running"  for  a brief moment and then it was gone. So
    i've   tried   to   build   proton   myself  following  [1]this
    instructions  but  ended  up  with  an error [2]that i couldn't
    solve   yet   .   So   i've   tried   to   run  it  again  with
    PROTON_NO_ESYNC=1   mesa_glthread=true   vblank_mode=0   launch
    options  and  no success. I don't know what to do now and thats
    why  im posting here to see if anyone can help or knows what to
    do.
    
    I appreciate any help and many thanks in advance.

     You might want to post in [1]SteamPlay
     I'm not totally sure because I've never built proton
     I wish there was a debug like in PlayOnLinux so we can see what
     is going on

     Proton can produced debug logs if you turn them on:
     [1]https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Proton-FAQ
     Check this site for compatibility and tips:
     [2]https://spcr.netlify.com/
     For each entry on that list, there's usually a link to the
     Proton issues on GitHub which sometimes has posts regarding
     workarounds.
     Make sure you have Vulkan installed! Type vulkaninfo to confirm

     Have you tried another game to confirm whether it's a problem
     with just ESO, or a problem with Proton in general? Bejeweled 2
     Deluxe has a free trial that works well in Proton. Also try
     restarting the Steam client if you haven't.

     What are your specs and what graphics drivers are you using?

     ** Sylorak
        Geforce Gtx 1060
        Driver: 396.54

        ** aaronfranke
           Try installing Python 2.7.

           ** NoXPhasma
              Python 2.7 isn't needed anymore. [1]That was fixed in
              Proton 3.7-5 .

              Its installed :/

              ** aaronfranke
                 Then I'm not sure. You seem to have things set up
                 correctly.
                 However, I'm using Xubuntu and not Debian. Valve
                 recommends Ubuntu by the way.

                 ** ImpersonalComputer
                    Ubuntu is based on Debian. Ubuntu derives its
                    packages from Debian Unstable.

                    ** aaronfranke
                       What's your point? Ubuntu may have things that
                       Steam Play needs and isn't installed by
                       default.
