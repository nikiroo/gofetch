		The fact that there are two drivers is the biggest headscratcher from AMD really since they started really doing a good job. I can&#x27;t see why they are fragmenting that one specific thing rather than just slowly merging it into RADV.

      <div class='comment_content'><p>Because radv isn't their driver and amdvlk shares its code with the windows driver.</p><p>But it's not that bad, as the biggest performance gains will likely come from optimizing llvm, which both drivers make use of*.</p><p>Also it's not a problem to install two Vulkan drivers side by side so users could always do that if they really need both.</p><p>* except for the pro stack, which uses a proprietary compiler shared with windows. I think their plan was to improve llvm and replace the proprietary compiler when llvm caught up in performance, but don't quote me on that</p></div>
