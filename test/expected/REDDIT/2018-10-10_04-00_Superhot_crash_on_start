    So  i  bought  Superhot  for  linux on steam , all my computers
    specs  are  above the minimum requirements tried to start it up
    (showed  a  black  screen)  and  crashed  seconds  after.  This
    happens  every  time  i  start  the  game  i  even restarted my
    computer  and  i see to be having the same problem as this post
    ( [1]https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/5zn46u/sup-
    erhot_crashes_on_startup/ ) but i didnt find a fix on there.
    
    Also  when  i  run it from the terminal with this command i get
    this  output  and  then  the  last line [Aborted (core dumped)]
    after the game crashes

     Can you try one of these as a game launch option? From Steam
     library:
     LC_ALL=C %command%
     or
     LANG=C %command%
