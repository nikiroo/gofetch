        Will there be cat DLC or spin-off? :-)

           Well you can play as the Proletaricat in it at least, that
           was in the trailer. There may be more cats that are
           playable too.

           [1]u/lustubus is right, there are a few playable cats in
           the game!

     OK, that looks really fun, and I'm not even that much into
     arcade games anymore.
     Congrats, your support of linux got you a sale. Probably more
     than one, 'cause now that I know/care about this, there's
     several folks I know that will probably want it too. Time to
     spread the word!

        Thanks so much, I hope you enjoy the game!
