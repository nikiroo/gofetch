    I  tried  using  the  Xbox  One  controller on my Kubuntu 18.04
    desktop  both  on  native (i.e. Tomb Raider & Life is Strange),
    and  via  Steam  Play  (i.e. Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 and Tekken
    7).  Steam  itself,  however,  was  able to see it. And running
    lsusb shows that the system can see it.
    
    I  was looking into this problem, and I found out just now that
    the  [1]Xbox  One  controller  is in the kernel . This [2]guide
    from  Make Tech Easier is outdated because xboxdrv doesn't work
    unless  it's  the Xbox 360 controller (I'm out of AA batteries,
    so  I  couldn't  test, but the software recognized it), and the
    [3]PPA  they  suggested  to  add  aren't up-to-date, unless I'm
    running Xenial or earlier.
    
    What else am I supposed to do in order for me to enable it?

     When using wired, it should be plug and play. Turn off
     controller support in steam, it may be interfering. Games should
     be able to talk with the controller directly.

        Yes, the Steam Controller API breaks input with XBOX One S
        Controller. Had to remove the Controller form Steam, since
        then it works fine.
        For wireless I can recommend [1]xpadneo .

           Edjt: yes, that's the solution!

     I have a bluetooth xbox one controller and in order to pair it I
     had to add "bluetooth.disable_ertm=1" to the Grub command line.
     USB though as others as stated it should work out of the box.
