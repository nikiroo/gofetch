		Part 1 of this series introduced the Julia project&#x27;s goals and development process, along with the language syntax, including the basics of control flow, data types, and, in more detail, how to work with arrays. In this part, user-defined functions and the central concept of multiple dispatch are described. It will also survey Julia&#x27;s module and package system, cover some syntax features, show how to make plots, and briefly dip into macros and distributed computing.
