		Many services, from web hosting and video streaming to cloud storage, need to move data to and from storage. They also often require that each per-client I/O flow be guaranteed a non-zero amount of bandwidth and a bounded latency. An expensive way to provide these guarantees is to over-provision storage resources, keeping each resource underutilized, and thus have plenty of bandwidth available for the few I/O flows dispatched to each medium. Alternatively one can use an I/O controller. Linux provides two mechanisms designed to throttle some I/O streams to allow others to meet their bandwidth and latency requirements. These mechanisms work, but they come at a cost: a loss of as much as 80% of total available I/O bandwidth. I have run some tests to demonstrate this problem; some upcoming improvements to the bfq I/O scheduler promise to improve the situation considerably.
