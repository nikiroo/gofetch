i    The  developers  of  the  Android system have, among their many
i    goals,  the  wish  to  better  protect  Android devices against
i    persistent  compromise.  It is bad if a device is taken over by
i    an  attacker; it's worse if it remains compromised even after a
i    reboot.  Numerous  mechanisms  for  ensuring  the  integrity of
i    installed  system files have been proposed and implemented over
i    the  years.  But it seems there is always room for one more; to
i    fill  that  space, the fs-verity mechanism is being proposed as
i    a way to protect individual files from malicious modification.
