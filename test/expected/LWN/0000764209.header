i    The  Spectre  variant  2  vulnerability  allows the speculative
i    execution   of  incorrect  (in  an  attacker-controllable  way)
i    indirect  branch  predictions,  resulting  in  the  ability  to
i    exfiltrate  information  via side channels. The kernel has been
i    reasonably  well  protected  against this variant since shortly
i    after  its  disclosure in January. It is, however, possible for
i    user-space  processes  to  use Spectre v2 to attack each other;
i    thus  far,  the  mainline  kernel has offered relatively little
i    protection  against  such  attacks.  A  recent [1]proposal from
i    Jiri  Kosina  may  change  that  situation, but there are still
i    some disagreements around the details.
