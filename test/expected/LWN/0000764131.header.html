		[1]GopherCon is the major conference for the [2]Go language , attended by 1600 dedicated &quot;gophers&quot;, as the members of its community like to call themselves. Held for the last five years in Denver, it attracts programmers, open-source contributors, and technical managers from all over North America and the world. GopherCon&#x27;s highly-technical program is an intense mix of Go internals and programming tutorials, a few of which we will explore in this article.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[1] https://www.gophercon.com/<br/><br/>[2] https://golang.org/ Subscribers can read on for a report from GopherCon by guest author Josh Berkus.
