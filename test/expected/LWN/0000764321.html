		The Harvard Business School&#x27;s &quot;Working Knowledge&quot; site has [1]an article arguing that it can pay for companies to allow their developers to contribute back to the projects whose software they use. &quot; And that presents an interesting dilemma for firms that rely heavily on open source. Should they allow employees on company time to make updates and edits to the software for community use that could be used by competitors? New research by Assistant Professor Frank Nagle, a member of the Strategy Unit at Harvard Business School, shows that paying employees to contribute to such software boosts the companyâ€™s productivity from using the software by as much as 100 percent, when compared with free-riding competitors. &quot;<br/><br/><br/><br/>[1] https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/the-hidden-benefit-of-giving-back-to-open-source-software

Most of the open source software improvements that might help a competitor are too general in nature to really be giving the other guys a competitive advantage.</p><p></p><p>For instance, if Lyft contributed Linux kernel or PHP or Apache or whatever fixes, the benefit to Lyft of having that improved expertise far exceeds the general benefit to competitor Uber.</p><p></p></div>

      <div class='comment_content'><p></p><p>Even having to debate it seems so farcical. If you're worried about people who "do the same thing", the software they use is not the main differentiator. How your company is organized, how you treat your people and your customers, how you organized projects etc are huge, and software is ultimately minor. Fixes and changes to software? Incredibly minor.</p><p></p></div>
