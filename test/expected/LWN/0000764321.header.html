		The Harvard Business School&#x27;s &quot;Working Knowledge&quot; site has an article arguing that it can pay for companies to allow their developers to contribute back to the projects whose software they use. &quot;And that presents an interesting dilemma for firms that rely heavily on open source. Should they allow employees on company time to make updates and edits to the software for community use that could be used by competitors? New research by Assistant Professor Frank Nagle, a member of the Strategy Unit at Harvard Business School, shows that paying employees to contribute to such software boosts the companyâ€™s productivity from using the software by as much as 100 percent, when compared with free-riding competitors.&quot;
