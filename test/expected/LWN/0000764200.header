i    Network  packet  headers  contain  a great deal of information,
i    but  the  kernel  often only needs a subset of that information
i    to  be  able to perform filtering or associate any given packet
i    with  a  flow.  The  piece  of  code that follows the different
i    layers  of  packet  encapsulation to find the important data is
i    called  a flow dissector. In current Linux kernels, the [1]flow
i    dissector  is  written  in  C. A [2]patch set has been proposed
i    recently  to  implement  it  in  BPF  with  the  clear  goal of
i    improving security, flexibility, and maybe even performance.
