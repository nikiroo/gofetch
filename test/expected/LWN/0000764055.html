		The annual Maintainer and Kernel Summits will be held in Vancouver, BC on November 12 to 15, in conjunction with the Linux Plumbers Conference. The program committee is looking for topics for both summits; read on for details on how to submit ideas and, perhaps, get an invitation to the Maintainer Summit.<br/><br/>From :<br/><br/>&quot;Theodore Y. Ts&#x27;o&quot; &lt;tytso-AT-mit.edu&gt;<br/><br/>To :<br/><br/>linux-kernel-AT-vger.kernel.org, linux-fsdevel-AT-vger.kernel.org, linux-mm-AT-kvack.org, netdev-AT-vger.kernel.org, linux-block-AT-vger.kernel.org<br/><br/>Subject :<br/><br/>Maintainer / Kernel Summit 2018 planning kick-off<br/><br/>Date :<br/><br/>Thu, 30 Aug 2018 17:35:17 -0400<br/><br/>Message-ID :<br/><br/>&lt;20180830213517.GA19110@thunk.org&gt;<br/><br/>Archive-link :<br/><br/>[1]Article<br/><br/><h2>Feel free to forward this to other Linux kernel mailing lists as<br/><br/>appropriate -- Ted</h2><br/><br/>This year, the Maintainer and Kernel Summit will be in Vancouver,<br/><br/>B.C., November 12th -- 15th. The Maintainer&#x27;s summit will be held on<br/><br/>Monday, November 12th, in Vancouver, immediately before the Linux<br/><br/>Plumber&#x27;s Conference (LPC) November 13th -- 15th.<br/><br/>For the past few years, before 2017, we&#x27;ve scheduled mostly management<br/><br/>and development process issues on the first day. We then opened up<br/><br/>the second day of the Kernel Summit to all attendees of the conference<br/><br/>with which the Kernel Summit has been colocated, and called it the<br/><br/>&quot;Open Technical Day&quot;. This is something that just made sense in order<br/><br/>to assure that all of the necessary people needed to discuss a<br/><br/>particular technical issue could be in the room.<br/><br/>Starting last year in Prague, we took the next logical step, and split<br/><br/>the Kernel Summit in two. The &quot;Maintainer&#x27;s Summit&quot; is an<br/><br/>invite-only, half-day event, where the primary focus will be process<br/><br/>issues of Linux Kernel Development. It will be limited to 30 invitees<br/><br/>and a handful of sponsored attendees. This makes it smaller than the<br/><br/>first few kernel summits (which were limited to around 50 attendees).<br/><br/>The &quot;Kernel Summit&quot; is now organized as a track which is run in<br/><br/>parallel with the other tracks at the Linux Plumber&#x27;s Conference, and<br/><br/>is open to all registered attendees of Plumbers. Much as how we<br/><br/>organized the Kernel Summit &quot;open technical day&quot; in 2016 in Santa Fe,<br/><br/>the Kernel Summit schedule will be synchronized with the other tracks<br/><br/>at the Plumber&#x27;s Conference, and it will be open to all registered<br/><br/>Plumber&#x27;s attendees.<br/><br/>Linus has suggested the following ten people as the core of the people<br/><br/>he would like invited to the Maintainer&#x27;s Summit, which was calculated<br/><br/>from statistics from his git tree.<br/><br/>David Miller<br/><br/>Dave Airlie<br/><br/>Greg KH<br/><br/>Arnd Bergmann<br/><br/>Ingo Molnar<br/><br/>Mauro Carvalho Chehab<br/><br/>Takashi Iwai<br/><br/>Thomas Gleixner<br/><br/>Andrew Morton<br/><br/>Olof Johansson<br/><br/>As we did last year, there will be a mini-program committee that will<br/><br/>be pick enough names to bring the total number of 30 for the<br/><br/>Maintainer&#x27;s Summit. That program committee will consist of Arnd<br/><br/>Bergmann, Thomas Gleixner, Greg KH, Paul McKenney, and Ted Ts&#x27;o.<br/><br/>We will use the rest of names on the list generated by Linus&#x27;s script<br/><br/>as a starting point of people to be considered. People who suggest<br/><br/>topics that should be discussed on the Maintainer&#x27;s summit will also<br/><br/>be added to the list. To make topic suggestions for the Maintainer&#x27;s<br/><br/>Summit, please send e-mail to the ksummit-discuss list with a subject<br/><br/>prefix of [MAINTAINERS SUMMIT].<br/><br/>The other job of the program committee will be to organize the program<br/><br/>for the Kernel Summit. The goal of the Kernel Summit track will be to<br/><br/>provide a forum to discuss specific technical issues that would be<br/><br/>easier to resolve in person than over e-mail. The program committee<br/><br/>will also consider &quot;information sharing&quot; topics if they are clearly of<br/><br/>interest to the wider development community (i.e., advanced training<br/><br/>in topics that would be useful to kernel developers).<br/><br/>To suggest a topic for the Kernel Summit, please tag your e-mail with<br/><br/>[TECH TOPIC]. As before, please use a separate e-mail for each topic,<br/><br/>and send the topic suggestions to:<br/><br/>ksummit-discuss@lists.linuxfoundation.org<br/><br/>People who submit topic suggestions before September 21st and which<br/><br/>are accepted, will be given a free admission to the Linux Plumbers<br/><br/>Conference.<br/><br/>We will reserving roughly half the Kernel Summit slots for last-minute<br/><br/>discussions that will be scheduled during the week of Plumber&#x27;s, in an<br/><br/>&quot;unconference style&quot;. This was extremely popular in Santa Fe and in<br/><br/>Prague, since it allowed ideas that came up in hallway discussions,<br/><br/>and in Plumber&#x27;s Miniconference, to be given scheduled, dedicated<br/><br/>times for that discussion.<br/><br/>If you were not subscribed on to the kernel-discuss mailing list from<br/><br/>last year (or if you had removed yourself after the kernel summit),<br/><br/>you can subscribe to the discuss list using mailman:<br/><br/>https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/ksummi...<br/><br/><br/><br/>[1] https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20180830213517.GA19110@thunk.org
