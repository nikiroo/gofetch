		Network packet headers contain a great deal of information, but the kernel often only needs a subset of that information to be able to perform filtering or associate any given packet with a flow. The piece of code that follows the different layers of packet encapsulation to find the important data is called a flow dissector. In current Linux kernels, the [1]flow dissector is written in C. A [2]patch set has been proposed recently to implement it in BPF with the clear goal of improving security, flexibility, and maybe even performance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[1] https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.18.6/source/net/core/flow_dissector.c<br/><br/>[2] https://lwn.net/Articles/763938/
