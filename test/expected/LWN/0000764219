    The  GNOME  Project  is  proud to announce the release of GNOME
    3.30, “Almería”
    
    This  release brings automatic updates in Software, more games,
    and a new
    
    Podcasts application.
    
    Improvements  to  core  GNOME  applications  include  a refined
    location and
    
    search
    
    bar  in  Files,  a  Thunderbold  panel in Settings, support for
    remoting using
    
    RDP
    
    in Boxes, and many more.
    
    More  information  about the changes in GNOME 3.30 can be found
    in the
    
    release notes:
    
    https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/3.30/
    
    For  the  release  team,  this release is particularly exciting
    because it is
    
    the
    
    first  one  that has been produced and verified with our new CI
    infrastructure
    
    in gitlab.gnome.org.
    
    GNOME  3.30 will be available shortly in many distributions. If
    you want to
    
    try it
    
    today,  you  can  use  the soon-to-be-released Fedora 29 or the
    openSUSE nightly
    
    live images which will both include GNOME 3.30 very soon.
    
    https://www.gnome.org/getting-gnome/
    
    http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/GNOME:/Medias/i...
    
    To  try the very latest developments in GNOME, you can also use
    Fedora
    
    Silverblue,
    
    whose rawhide branch always includes the latest GNOME packages.
    
    https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/compose/rawhide/latest...
    
    If  you are interested in building applications for GNOME 3.30,
    look for the
    
    GNOME  3.30  Flatpak  SDK,  which  will  be  available  in  the
    sdk.gnome.org
    
    repository
    
    soon.
    
    This  six-month  effort wouldn't have been possible without the
    whole
    
    GNOME  community,  made  of  contributors  and friends from all
    around the
    
    world:  developers, designers, documentation writers, usability
    and
    
    accessibility  specialists, translators, maintainers, students,
    system
    
    administrators,  companies,  artists, testers and last, but not
    least, our
    
    users.
    
    GNOME  would  not  exist  without  all  of  you.  Thank  you to
    everyone!
    
    Our  next release, GNOME 3.32, is planned for March 2019. Until
    then,
    
    enjoy GNOME 3.30!
