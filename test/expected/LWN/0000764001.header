i    [1]Part  1  of  this  series  introduced the [2]Julia project's
i    goals  and development process, along with the language syntax,
i    including  the basics of control flow, data types, and, in more
i    detail,  how  to  work  with arrays. In this part, user-defined
i    functions  and  the  central  concept  of multiple dispatch are
i    described.  It  will  also  survey  Julia's  module and package
i    system,  cover  some  syntax  features, show how to make plots,
i    and briefly dip into macros and distributed computing.
