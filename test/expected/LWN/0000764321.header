i    The  Harvard  Business  School's  "Working  Knowledge" site has
i    [1]an  article  arguing  that it can pay for companies to allow
i    their  developers  to  contribute  back  to  the projects whose
i    software  they  use. " And that presents an interesting dilemma
i    for  firms  that rely heavily on open source. Should they allow
i    employees  on  company  time  to  make updates and edits to the
i    software  for  community use that could be used by competitors?
i    New  research  by  Assistant Professor Frank Nagle, a member of
i    the  Strategy  Unit  at  Harvard  Business  School,  shows that
i    paying  employees  to  contribute  to  such software boosts the
i    companyâ€™s  productivity  from  using the software by as much as
i    100 percent, when compared with free-riding competitors. "
