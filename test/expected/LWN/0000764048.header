i    Security  and  convenience  rarely go hand-in-hand, but if your
i    job  (or  life) requires extraordinary care against potentially
i    targeted  attacks,  the  security side of that tradeoff may win
i    out.  If  so, running a system like [1]Qubes OS on your desktop
i    or  [2]CopperheadOS  on  your  phone might make sense, which is
i    just  what Konstantin Ryabitsev, Linux Foundation (LF) director
i    of  IT  security,  has done. He reported on the experience in a
i    [3]talk  [YouTube  video]  entitled  "Life  Behind  the Tinfoil
i    Curtain" at the 2018 [4]Linux Security Summit North America .
