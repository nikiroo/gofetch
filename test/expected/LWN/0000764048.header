i    Security  and  convenience  rarely go hand-in-hand, but if your
i    job  (or  life) requires extraordinary care against potentially
i    targeted  attacks,  the  security side of that tradeoff may win
i    out.  If  so, running a system like QubesÂ OS on your desktop or
i    CopperheadOS  on  your  phone  might  make sense, which is just
i    what  Konstantin  Ryabitsev,  Linux Foundation (LF) director of
i    IT  security, has done. He reported on the experience in a talk
i    [YouTube  video]  entitled "Life Behind the Tinfoil Curtain" at
i    the 2018 Linux Security Summit North America.
