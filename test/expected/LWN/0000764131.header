i    GopherCon   is  the  major  conference  for  the  Go  language,
i    attended  by  1600  dedicated  "gophers", as the members of its
i    community  like  to  call  themselves.  Held  for the last five
i    years   in   Denver,   it   attracts  programmers,  open-source
i    contributors,  and  technical  managers  from  all  over  North
i    America  and the world. GopherCon's highly-technical program is
i    an  intense  mix  of  Go internals and programming tutorials, a
i    few  of  which we will explore in this article. Subscribers can
i    read  on  for  a  report  from  GopherCon  by guest author Josh
i    Berkus.
