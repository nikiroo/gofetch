i    [1]GopherCon  is  the major conference for the [2]Go language ,
i    attended  by  1600  dedicated  "gophers", as the members of its
i    community  like  to  call  themselves.  Held  for the last five
i    years   in   Denver,   it   attracts  programmers,  open-source
i    contributors,  and  technical  managers  from  all  over  North
i    America  and the world. GopherCon's highly-technical program is
i    an  intense  mix  of  Go internals and programming tutorials, a
i    few of which we will explore in this article.
